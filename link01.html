	CHAPTER FIVE China’s Expanding Diplomatic Toolkit
	</font>	
	</center>

	<font size=5>
	<br><br>

	
	One of the most notable features of China’s international behavior in
the past decade has been the number of newly utilized and enhanced
tools of statecraft that it has put into operation in pursuit of its objectives.<br><br>
This monograph identifies five categories of tools: economic diplomacy,
leadership diplomacy, multilateral diplomacy, strategic partnerships,
and military diplomacy. In many instances, the application of
these tools is overlapping and mutually supportive; the distinctions
among these five types of statecraft are drawn for ease of analysis.<br><br>
Economic Diplomacy<br><br>
Economic diplomacy (jingji waijiao 经济外交) has become a central
theme in China’s foreign policy under Hu Jintao. Economic diplomacy
has come to mean using trade, investment, and, increasingly,
finance policies to support China’s diplomatic goals and also using
classic diplomacy to advance China’s economic development, such as
by ensuring access to foreign markets. Both aspects of economic diplomacy
are somewhat novel for China, which has traditionally viewed
diplomacy and economic affairs as separate and distinct. Wen Jiabao
highlighted this concept’s importance in a seminal August 2004 State
Council meeting that was regarded as a milestone event anointing the
concept. The idea was further developed during a December 2004 foreign
ministry “Seminar on Diplomacy and the Economy.” During the
latter meeting, Assistant Foreign Minister Lu Guozeng explained the contribution of economically oriented diplomacy to national development.<br><br>
He stated:<br><br>
New developments in the international and domestic situations
are imposing higher and higher requirements on our work in various
fields. We have to further implement the concept of scientific
development, coordinate domestic development and opening up
to the outside world, firmly grasp the opportunities for development
and strive to build a better-off society. . . . With the development
and change in the situation, the implications and functions
of diplomacy are also changing. It is gradually expanding
from political and security areas to economic and cultural fields.
While ensuring national sovereignty and security, diplomacy has
to shoulder heavier and heavier tasks in safeguarding national
economic interests and promoting domestic development.1<br><br>
Multiple Tools<br><br>
China’s economic diplomacy has several dimensions. One of the most
prominent ones has been China’s initiation, negotiation, or conclusion
of free trade agreements (FTAs). As of 2009, China has concluded
FTAs with Chile, Hong Kong, Macao, Pakistan, Singapore, Peru, and
New Zealand and is in negotiation with a few others, notably Australia
and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).2 China’s largest FTA,
with the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), is set to enter into force in 2010, though some “early harvest”
tariff liberalization measures were adopted in 2004 (Table 5.1).<br><br>
China’s use of FTAs contributes to three Chinese foreign policy
objectives: (1) expand China’s access to markets, investment, and technology,
(2) gain access to strategic resources, and (3) reassure other
nations that China’s growth will not undermine their economic interests. More tactically, China has successfully used FTAs to gain
commitments from several countries to provide China with marketeconomy
status (MES), a legal determination under World Trade Organization
(WTO) rules. For some nations, such as Australia, China
required MES as a condition for simply beginning negotiations on an
FTA. As of early 2009, nearly 80 countries had recognized China as
a market economy under WTO rules. Notable exceptions include the
United States, Japan, and the European Union (EU). MES is important
for China as a mark of status for the success of its economic
reforms and also because it reduces the potential penalties that states could impose on China in anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases
under WTO rules.<br><br>

<a href= "pic02.html">Table 5.1 China’s Free Trade Agreements</a><br><br>
China’s economic diplomacy has several finance dimensions as
well. In early 2006, China initiated “finance dialogues” (jinrong duihua
金融对话) with several countries to go beyond bilateral exchanges on
classic trade and investment issues. This new channel is specifically
between finance ministries and central banks, and it covers macroeconomic
policymaking, national finance and tax policies, and exchange
rate practices. To date, China has established such dialogues with the
United States, the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, Brazil, India,
Russia, and Japan.3 With a select group of major global economies,
China initiated high-level economic dialogues, including with the
United States, Japan, the UK, and the EU.<br><br>
In late 2008 and early 2009, China further developed its financial
diplomacy by rapidly concluding currency swap agreements totaling
650 billion renminbi (RMB) ($95 billion) with six nations; the aim of
these agreements is to improve these nations’ access to renminbi as a
way to facilitate trade transactions during the global recession and the
shortage of U.S. dollars. According to the Web site of the People’s Bank
of China, “Central banks use currency swaps to address the short-term
liquidity problem and cope with the current crisis more efficiently and
safeguard stability of the financial system.” As of April 2009, China
has signed agreements with Argentina (70 billion RMB), Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (200 billion RMB), Malaysia (80 billion RMB),
Belarus (20 billion RMB), South Korea (180 billion RMB), and Indonesia
(100 billion RMB).4<br><br>

Moreover, China continues to expand its outward direct investment
(ODI), with a cumulative total stock of $117.9 billion globally in
2007.5 The substantial and rapid growth in ODI is partly a result of a state-directed policy that was adopted in the late 1990s and reinforced
in 2003. It is called the “go out” strategy (zou chu qu 走出去), and it
calls for Chinese companies to move into global markets to grow their
revenue, to learn to be globally competitive, and, if possible, to acquire
international brands. Chinese companies, mainly state-owned enterprises,
have invested in foreign transportation, infrastructure, and telecommunications
projects. In some cases, these projects are undertaken
to allow other Chinese companies to gain preferential access to energy
and other strategic resources; some of these investments have even been
made on a loss-making basis to gain access to these nations’ resources.<br><br>
This approach has been used in Africa and Latin America. China also
touts its growing ODI as a sign of China’s contribution to the economic
development of other nations, as a further means of reassuring
other nations and increasing China’s influence6 (Figure 5.1).<br><br>
Foreign aid is a fourth major aspect of China’s economic diplomacy.<br><br>
China’s foreign aid includes both development and humanitarian
assistance, with the latter as a new practice. China’s development
aid takes the form of grants, loans, and technical assistance, which
is similar to official development assistance (ODA) as defined by the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).<br><br>
Using the OECD standard, China’s development aid is a “relatively
small source of global aid,” according to a Congressional Research
Service report.7 However in evaluating Chinese foreign aid, it is also
important to include China’s state-sponsored or subsidized overseas
investment; this is often provided through the China Development
Bank or the China Export-Import Bank, which are not part of China’s nascent foreign aid bureaucracy. When this latter category of funds is
factored in, China “becomes a major source of foreign aid.”8<br><br>

<a href= "pic03.html">Figure 5.1 China’s Annual Outward Direct Investment, 1990C2007</a><br><br>

It remains unclear how the State Council organizes and directs
China’s foreign aid bureaucracy, which appears to be fragmented and
uncoordinated. The government does not define foreign aid or publish
comprehensive statistics, making calculations difficult and inconsistent.<br><br>
China’s Ministry of Commerce, which is officially in charge of
the foreign aid budget, started publishing aggregate statistics on foreign
aid only in 2002.9 The official Ministry of Commerce figure for external
assistance in 2002 was $602.77 million; in 2003, it was $630.36<br><br>

million; in 2004, it was $731 million10; in 2005, it was $922 million;
and in 2006, it was $1.1 billion.11 According to CRS data, these statistics
significantly undercount Chinese foreign assistance by not including,
for example, subsidized financing for overseas investment projects.<br><br>
“PRC foreign assistance and government-supported economic projects
in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia grew from less than
$1 billion in 2002 to $27.5 billion in 2006 and $25 billion in 2007.”12<br><br>
China’s provision of foreign aid has grown particularly fast since
2004 as Beijing has sought to use its assistance to build and sustain
political relations with its Asian neighbors and especially with African
nations. In 2004, China pledged to provide $400 million to help
finance, using preferential loans, the development of the first phase of
a new railroad line in the Philippines. China has pledged to forgive the
loan debts of poor countries in Southeast Asia (such as Cambodia and
Laos); in 2005 and 2006, Hu Jintao promised to forgive more than $10
billion in past loans to African nations. Notably, during the November
2006 China-Africa Cooperation Forum (CACF) in Beijing, the Chinese
government announced a large eight-part, multiyear development
aid package for all African nations. The package included a doubling,
by 2009, of China’s 2006 level of aid to Africa; $5 billion in concessional
financing to African companies; major loan forgiveness for heavily indebted poor countries; and extensive technical assistance.13<br><br>
In June 2007, China agreed to forgive almost $10 million in Iraqi
debt accumulated by the previous government―both government-togovernment
debt and that of Chinese state enterprises. Interestingly, a
year later, Iraq concluded its first major oil deal with a foreign nation
since 2003, with a Chinese state-owned firm, for technical assistance in
developing oil fields; the deal was reportedly worth $3 billion.14<br><br>
Although China’s foreign aid has traditionally focused on development
assistance (often with corresponding market access for Chinese
firms), provision of humanitarian aid is a new and growing dimension
of its foreign aid portfolio. In response to the tsunami disaster
in Southeast Asia in 2004C2005, the Chinese government donated
$83 million in assistance, which was the largest amount of humanitarian
assistance China had ever provided at that time. The Chinese
government publicly reported in early 2006 that in 2005 it had offered
(but not necessarily distributed) a record amount of humanitarian aid: almost one billion RMB ($123.45 million) in disaster relief to three
large projects (e.g., Indian Ocean Tsunami relief, Pakistan earthquake
relief, and Hurricane Katrina relief) as well as a smaller amount of aid
to North Korea, Vietnam, Romania, Iran, Guinea-Bissau, and Ecuador.
Chinese officials have stated that the government has established
an “emergency response mechanism” to enable quick dispersal of disaster
relief aid in the future.15<br><br>
An Alternative Development Model?
China’s economic diplomacy immediately raises concerns about
whether it is promoting its experience of rapid and sustained economic
growth as an alternative to Western models of development, a competition
of ideas commonly referred to as the “Beijing Consensus” versus
the “Washington Consensus.” Although China clearly sees value in
using a variety of economic and financial policies to promote Chinese
interests, it is far less clear that it has a distinct development model,
that others could replicate it, and that China is promoting itself as an
alternative to U.S. or Western approaches.<br><br>
China’s economic policies over the last 30 years are not unique compared
with other Asian countries, and China’s policies have been fairly
consistent with the Washington Consensus. China’s hybrid “socialistmarket
economy” is similar (but not identical) to the postCWorld War
II experiences of Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan in using
state ownership and state direction to promote industrial development,
to build a large export sector, and to open up to foreign investment.<br><br>
Indeed, South Korea and Taiwan were one-party governments for the
first several decades of their economic development.<br><br>
China’s approach has also been consistent with key attributes of
the Washington Consensus; China has emphasized low fiscal deficits,
gradual structural reforms, privatization, trade promotion, infrastructure
development, workforce training, and innovation.16 China benefited from a unique set of attributes that few economies share, such as
the huge productivity gains associated with the transition from a largely
agrarian to an industrial economy; a massive, low-cost workforce that
has become increasingly well-skilled (but is still relatively low-cost); a
huge and appealing domestic market; and an entrepreneurial tradition
that emphasizes business competition.<br><br>
For these and other reasons, Chinese leaders seldom proclaim that
China represents a unique development model that others should follow,
preferring to highlight China’s unique conditions. Chinese leaders are
happy to share China’s experiences with developing nations (including
both successes and failures) and to highlight the weaknesses of Western
ideas.17 But they also stop short of stating that China’s success can and
should be replicated by developing nations. This diplomatic approach
is motivated, in part, by China’s effort to appear cooperative and as
not imposing its ideas on others. Some Chinese are concerned that
promoting a Beijing Consensus would directly confront the United
States and other Western powers, undermining its reassurance strategy.
It is instructive that the idea of a Beijing Consensus was developed by
a Western journalist, not by Chinese policymakers.18 None of China’s
top leaders―the president, premier, or foreign minister―have promoted
this idea, preferring instead to emphasize China’s uniqueness.<br><br>
To the extent that China is seen as promoting such a model, it is
because many developing nations admire China’s economic successes
and profess support for a “China model.” For example, many African
nations during the 2006 China-Africa Cooperation Forum in Beijing
noted their desire to replicate China’s experiences, even though few
have taken any steps resembling Chinese policies. Some developing nations, such as Brazil and Venezuela, have sought partners in opposing
some Western economic policies and have looked to China for support;
they try to draw China into an effort to oppose these policies and
practices, even though China supports many of them. China is most
interested in increasing its global economic clout through trade and
finance interactions (as described above) and by expanding its role in
international financial institutions.<br><br>
Leadership Diplomacy<br><br>
China’s top party and state leaders now frequently travel abroad in
direct pursuit of China’s diplomatic objectives. Some in China have
termed this new trend “leadership diplomacy” (lingdao waijiao 领导
外交). Although leaders of all countries conduct such activities, for
China the number and frequency of leadership visits have significantly
increased since the beginning of the reform period and especially under
Hu Jintao. Before 1978, foreign trips were relatively few and evidenced
no unique pattern. China’s third generation of leaders, led by Jiang
Zemin, increased the number of such trips. As demonstrated in Figure
5.2, China’s top leaders (defined as the president, the premier, the
head of the National People’s Congress (NPC), or the chairman of the
Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference) have significantly
ramped up their foreign travels since 1992, growing from 122 between
1981 and 1991 to 424 in the 1992C2006 period.<br><br>
As seen in Figure 5.3, the regional distribution of leaders’ visits
from 1949 to 2006 highlights, in broad terms, China’s long-standing
diplomatic priorities: Asia has been the primary focus for decades (with
250 visits), followed by Europe (196), Africa (92), Latin America (50),
Oceania (26), and North America (19). The final figure of only 19 trips to
North America should not be so surprising given the freeze in U.S.-China
relations during the Cold War. According to a study by Chinese scholars
Zhang Qingmin and Liu Bing, between 1949 and 1991 senior Chinese
leaders visited North America only seven times; this compares with 98 trips to Asia, 54 to Europe, and 31 to Africa.19 During the 1992C2006
period, senior leader visits increased most substantially to Asia, Europe,
and Latin America (Figure 5.4).<br><br>

<a href= "pic06.html">Figure 5.4 Period Breakdown of Chinese Leaders’ Regional Visits, 1949C2006</a><br><br>



In the last ten years, China’s top leaders have regularly used trips
to advance high-priority diplomatic objectives.20 Several Politburo officials
traveled to North Korea between 2003 and 2008 as part of China’s
effort to manage the North Korean nuclear crisis and the negotiations
within the Six Party Process. Premier Wen Jiabao’s frequent
travels abroad have been at the forefront of China’s efforts to improve
its relations with East Asian and South Asian nations. Notably, Wen
Jiabao traveled to Thailand in 2003 in the wake of the SARS crisis in
China to reassure China’s neighbors that it was taking serious steps to curb the spread of the disease. Since then, Wen has become the
senior Chinese representative to the annual week of meetings of the
ASEAN+3 (ASEAN plus China, Japan, and South Korea) and the East
Asia Summit. Wen hosted the ASEAN-China 15th anniversary conference
in Nanning, China, in 2007, as a way to underscore the importance
to China of its ties to ASEAN states and vice versa. Wen has also
been at the forefront of China’s effort to embrace India; he traveled to
India for a major bilateral summit in April 2005 that resulted in the
establishment of a strategic partnership with India―a first for these
longtime rivals. Perhaps most significantly, Premier Wen visited Japan
in April 2007 in a seminal visit that “thawed the ice” in Sino-Japanese
relations and injected some stability into that rocky relationship.<br><br>
Beyond Asia, Wen Jiabao has been at the center of China’s effort
to manage its response to the global financial crisis that began in 2008.<br><br>
Wen was China’s representative to the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, in early 2009. With the intention of reassuring the
international community, he publicly stated that China expected an
8 percent growth rate in 2009, defying most international projections.<br><br>
Attendance at Davos was followed by visits to capitals of the major
EU states, including Berlin, Brussels (EU headquarters), Madrid, and
London.21 In 2006, Wen Jiabao took a week-long, seven-nation tour
of Africa, which helped prepare for China’s hosting of the high-level
China-Africa summit meeting in November 2006, which included
48 African nations. Wu Bangguo, the chairman of the NPC and the
second-highest official in the party, has often traveled abroad to establish
dialogues with the elected parliaments in other nations with the
goal of boosting the legitimacy of China’s parliament in the eyes of
Chinese citizens and other countries’ populations.<br><br>
President Hu Jintao’s major trips abroad since assuming power in
2002 have been a central part of China’s effort to expand its presence
and influence in the developing world (mainly Africa, the Middle East,
Central Asia, and Latin America) and specifically to improve China’s
access to strategic minerals and energy resources. Hu’s four trips to Africa (in 2002, 2006, 2007, and 2009) and two to Latin America
(in 2004 and 2008) have directly expanded China’s economic interactions
with these regions.22 Hu Jintao has visited Africa four times since
2002, visiting over 18 African nations in total, which is an unprecedented
regional focus for a Chinese president. In early 2009, Hu traveled
to the four, nonresource-rich African nations of Senegal, Mali,
Tanzania, and Mauritius to try to underscore that China’s Africa diplomacy
was not just focused on gaining access to natural resources. This
four-nation trip followed a longer 12-day tour in 2007 of seven African
countries, including visits to such controversial destinations as Sudan
and Zimbabwe.<br><br>
Furthermore, Hu Jintao is actively involved in managing China’s
relations with former Soviet states. He has visited Russia almost annually
since 2002, and he attends the annual summits of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization. In 2007 and 2008, he made state visits to
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.<br><br>
China also deploys the president for strategic purposes when it
seeks to upgrade its commitment to a nation, to a group of countries,
or to an international issue. In 2003, Hu Jintao attended, for the first
and only time (to date), the China-EU summit when a “strategic partnership”
was formed; this was during a period when Beijing sought
to leverage tensions in trans-Atlantic relations to advance China-EU
cooperation on international issues. In May 2008, Hu Jintao made a
state visit to Japan to fully normalize China-Japan relations; this was
the first trip to Japan for China’s top leader since Jiang Zemin’s 1998
visit, which many in both countries viewed as a failure because Jiang
lectured the Japanese about historical issues. Hu Jintao is China’s representative
to the annual meetings of the G-8, even though China is
not a full member of that group. Hu attended the G-20 summit in
Washington in November 2008 and in London in April 2009.
Hu and Wen’s presumed successors have jumped on the leadership
diplomacy bandwagon. Vice President Xi Jinping, who many
believe will succeed Hu Jintao, has similarly focused his foreign trips
on improving China’s ties with developing nations. During his first 

foreign trip as vice president, in 2008, he visited North Korea, Mongolia,
and three Middle Eastern nations (Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and
Qatar). Later that year, he visited five Latin American nations (Mexico,
Jamaica, Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil) and Malta. In February
2009, Xi again visited Venezuela, China’s eighth largest supplier of
imported crude oil (in 2007). Vice Premier Li Keqiang, during his first
overseas trip in his current position, visited Kuwait and Indonesia in
December 2008.<br><br>
Another dimension of China’s leadership diplomacy has been the
designation and use of “special envoys” (teshi daibiao 特使代表) to
handle particularly problematic issues in Chinese foreign policy. Since
1993, China has designated several new special envoys and deployed
them all over the world. China’s first special envoy was assigned to
the North Korean nuclear issue, and China currently has designated
envoys to address issues in Africa/Sudan, the Middle East, and, in
2009, to Afghanistan/Pakistan. As depicted in Figure 5.5, the number
of foreign visits of special envoys increased substantially in 2006 and
2007, suggesting Chinese leaders’ growing interest in this new diplomatic
tool.<br><br>

<a href= "pic07.html">Figure 5.5 Frequency of Special Envoys’ Foreign Travels, 1993C2007</a><br><br>


Multilateral Diplomacy<br><br>
A new, important, and deftly used diplomatic tool for China is its participation
in multilateral organizations (Tables 5.2 and 5.3). China
clearly sees such organizations as venues in which to advance its vision
of fostering a multipolar world, greater “democracy in international
relations,” and building a harmonious world. The 2008 national defense
white paper was uniquely clear on this point, “China is playing an active
and constructive role in multilateral affairs, thus notably elevating its
international position and influence.”23 More instrumentally, China
uses multilateral organizations as mechanisms for reassurance, gaining
access to key economic inputs, limiting U.S. influence in certain regions, and expanding China’s regional influence in general. In fact, China has
played a central role in creating a variety of new multilateral forums
in regions all over the world. This process has given Chinese leaders a
unique stake in the vitality of these mechanisms.<br><br>

<a href= "pic08.html">Table 5.2 China’s Membership in Regional Organizations</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic09.html">Table 5.3 Regional Organizations Established by China</a><br><br>



China’s embrace of multilateral organizations has been most pronounced
and most effective in East Asia.24 Since the early 1990s, China
has become actively involved in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) (1991), the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) (1994), ASEAN+1
(ASEAN plus China) (1996), ASEAN+3 (1997), and the East Asia
Summit (EAS) (2005). Such participation has been instrumental in
China’s effort to burnish its image, grow economic cooperation, and expand its regional influence. In 2003, China was key to the creation
and maintenance of the Six-Party process for negotiating North Korea’s
denuclearization. In 2002, China was a founding member of the Asian
Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), which fosters dialogue among separate
regional organizations, such as ASEAN, the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), and the Gulf Cooperation Council.<br><br>
China has been working to expand regional nongovernment
interactions as well. In 2001, a group of Chinese nationals and overseas
Chinese business leaders established the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA),
a nongovernmental, nonprofit international organization based on
Hainan Island in China and modeled after the World Economic Forum
in Davos. As with the Davos meeting, BFA draws together senior Asian
officials, business leaders, and scholars. The BFA was the venue, in 2003, for the launching of China’s new foreign policy strategy of
“peaceful rise/peaceful development.”<br><br>
Beyond East Asia, China initiated the formation, in 1996, of the
Shanghai Five, which included China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
and Tajikistan; this forum subsequently became the more formal
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in 2001 with the addition
of Uzbekistan. Since 2005, China has been an official observer
of SAARC, along with the United States.25 (In exchange, China supported
India’s participation in the SCO as an observer.)
Beyond Asia, in 2000 China formed the China-Africa Cooperation
Forum; it has held three ministerial meetings to date, including hosting a major 48-nation summit in Beijing in late 2006. In 2004,
China created the China-Arab Cooperation Forum that has held two
ministerial meetings to date. China joined many of the major regional
forums in Latin America. It become a full member of the Inter-
American Development Bank (IADB) in 2008 and is an observer in
the Organization of American States (OAS). It has established dialogues
with the Rio Group, the Mercosur common market group, the
Caribbean Community, and the Latin American Conference.26<br><br>
Strategic Partnerships
China has developed a diplomatic mechanism to expand its international
influence―the establishment of “strategic partnerships” (zhanlue
huoban guanxi 战略伙伴关系) with both individual states and
groupings of states. Table 5.4 summarizes these partnerships.<br><br>
For China, strategic partnership has a different meaning from
the Western connotation of the term.27 <br><br>


<a href= "pic10.html">Table 5.4 China’s Strategic Partnerships</a><br><br>

They are not treated as quasimilitary
alliances, which involve extensive security and military
cooperation, as implied by the term “strategic.” Rather, in the Chinese
foreign policy lexicon, a partnership is strategic for two reasons:
(1) It is comprehensive, including all aspects of bilateral relations
(e.g., economic, cultural, political, and security), and (2) both
countries agree to make a long-term commitment to bilateral relations,
in which bilateral problems are evaluated in that context and,
importantly, occasional tensions do not derail them. Establishing
these partnerships allows China to raise the level of its interactions 


with partner countries (or groupings) and also allows China to set the
scope, content, and pace of engagement. This logic explains the eclectic
variety of states, groupings of states, and multilateral organizations
with which China has established such strategic partnerships.28<br><br>
These strategic partnerships have broad and varied content.<br><br>
China stresses several themes, including opportunities for joint economic
development resulting from trade and investment; coordination
in international affairs, which means adopting common foreign
policy positions, such as at the U.N.; cooperation on nontraditional
security issues; enhancing the influence of multilateral organizations;
the mutual endorsement of U.N. principles and the rule of law in international
relations; and promoting China’s concepts of “democracy and
equality in international relations.”29<br><br>
China has more specific goals in pursuing these partnerships as
well. It uses them as mechanisms to expand economic opportunities
(especially to gain preferential access to nations’ markets, investment,
and natural resources), to stabilize and shape China’s regional security
environment, to reduce external constraints on China, and to bolster
its international reputation as a responsible major power. Importantly,
Beijing uses these diplomatic structures to generate bargaining leverage
in its bilateral interactions. Such partnerships allow China to define
the standards of cooperation that partners are expected to meet; this
increases China’s ability to manipulate its interlocutors to accept Chinese
goals.<br><br>
In recent years, China has also initiated “strategic dialogues” with
many of these nations; this is a further indication of its effort to deepen
political relationships to further generate influence and leverage. These
dialogues usually occur at the level of deputy foreign minister or vice
foreign minister, and the topics cover a wide range of security issues
including arms control, WMD nonproliferation, nontraditional security challenges, and long-standing territorial disputes. China first
established such a channel with Russia in 1996 following a summit
meeting, but it was not given the name of “strategic dialogue” until
years later. A similar pattern emerged with France in the late 1990s.
In 2005, China’s convening of such strategic dialogues took off. In
that year alone, Beijing held inaugural sessions with the United States,
India, the UK, Japan, and the EU. In 2006, during a summit meeting
in Beijing, China and Germany also pledged to initiate an annual
strategic dialogue.<br><br>
To varying degrees, China has used its strategic partnerships with
major powers, such as with Russia, France, and the EU, to broaden
its economic relationships, to foster the development of other power
centers in global politics, and to seek support for its vision of a multipolar
global order. These major power partnerships do not amount to
building an anti-U.S. coalition to balance against U.S. power. However,
these partnerships allow China greater options and help it to
foster an environment that could be used to constrain U.S. unilateral
actions, especially if that power is directed at Chinese interests.30 There
is no overtly anti-U.S. element in such Chinese diplomacy, but China’s
discomfort with perceived U.S. unilateralism is one of the drivers of
its strategic partnerships. These themes and motivations were readily
apparent in the 2003 EU-China Joint Statement, which founded that
strategic partnership during a period of trans-Atlantic tension, as well
as in the Russia-China Joint Communiqué and the SCO’s summit
statement in July 2005.<br><br>
China’s strategic partnerships with these major powers are
bounded by two considerations that limit their potential to be potent
mechanisms for balancing U.S. power. First, China’s interests with all
of these major powers, especially Russia and India, both converge and
diverge―on different issues and to different degrees. There is no single,
dominant political or strategic logic to any of these strategic partnerships
that could serve as the basis for collectively and consistently countervailing U.S. power. Indeed, most of China’s strategic partners are not
interested in creating a de facto coalition to balance U.S. power, with the
possible exception of Russia. These nations have numerous interests in
positive relations with the United States. Also, although there are many
cooperative dimensions to China’s strategic partnerships, they are also
fraught with tensions on both economic and security questions. For
example, Russia and China may have common interests related to constraining
U.S. influence globally and in Central Asia, but they diverge
on economic issues and security questions revolving around access to
Central Asian energy supplies and Chinese influence in Russia’s Far
East.31 Also, for China, Russia has shown itself to be an unreliable partner
in the past. China’s unwillingness in summer 2008 to endorse the
Russian position on the independence of the Georgian enclaves exemplifies
the limits of the Sino-Russian strategic partnership.<br><br>
A second major consideration is that, historically, China has not
favored or relied on alliances (or even strong bilateral partnerships) in
its diplomacy. China’s historic disposition in favor of independence and
against relying on alliances calls into question the extent to which it
can or will rely on them now. Although China has formed alliances in
the past (e.g., the ChinaCSoviet Union alliance of the 1950s), it was
never entirely comfortable with them. Beijing prefers, instead, greater
autonomy to maximize its leverage and maneuverability.32 This enduring
predisposition is evident in the intensifying concerns among Chinese
elites about the economic and security vulnerabilities that have
resulted from China’s global interdependence and the globalization of national security challenges.33 China’s historical predispositions were
further confirmed in 2001 when Russia shifted away from its emerging
anti-U.S. cooperation with China and turned back toward greater
rapprochement with the United States, even before 9/11. Specifically,
Russia abandoned China in their joint opposition to U.S. missile
defense policies.<br><br>
These events, thus, suggest a third possible constraint on the scope
of China’s strategic partnerships: Most major powers have more interests
at stake in their relations with the United States than with China.
Some states may not be willing to jeopardize their ties with the United
States to coordinate with China in an effort, implicit or explicit, to
constrain the United States.<br><br>
Military Diplomacy34<br><br>
Military diplomacy has assumed a greater role in China’s international
behavior. A key turning point came in 2004 when China indicated
in its national defense white paper that it had elevated the value of
military diplomacy “to the strategic level” in national statecraft.35 Following
this important determination, PLA actions have since reflected
a greater use of bilateral and multilateral military-to-military interactions
to broaden its political relations with neighbors in East, Central,
and South Asia, as well as Africa and Latin America. China is clearly
using its military diplomacy to reassure Asian nations, to demystify the
PLA, to expand China’s influence with militaries, to gain experience and knowledge from more capable militaries, and to shape PLA counterparts’<br><br>
perceptions of China.<br><br>
Although the content of these exchanges is still quite limited given
the PLA’s penchant for carefully guarding national defense information,
the scope of China’s military exchanges is growing. According to
China’s 2008 national defense white paper:<br><br>
China has established military ties with over 150 countries, and
has military attaché offices in 109 countries. A total of 98 countries
have military attach offices in China. In the past two years
[2006C2008] senior PLA delegations have visited more than 40
countries, and defense ministers and chiefs of the general staff
from more than 60 countries have visited China.<br><br>
. . . .<br><br>
In the past two years [2006C2008] it has sent over 900 military
students to more than 30 countries. Twenty military educational
institutions in China have established and maintained intercollegiate
exchange relations with their counterparts in over 20
countries, including the United States, Russia, Japan and Pakistan.
Meanwhile, some 4,000 military personnel from more than
130 countries have come to China to study at Chinese military
educational institutions.36<br><br>
This expanding breadth of China’s military diplomacy is a further
indication that China is using such exchanges to manage its security
relations with other nations. These interactions could become more
substantive over time, depending on China’s goals and recipients’ willingness
to increase interactions with the PLA.<br><br>
Moreover, China now conducts annual defense exchanges with
all its Asian neighbors, select European and African countries, and
major powers such as the United States and Russia; it even conducts
intelligence exchanges within some of its defense consultations. Joint
exercises have become a new component of China’s defense diplomacy.<br><br>
From 2002 to 2008, the PLA conducted over 40 joint military exercises and joint training exercises with over 20 countries, which is a
new and growing practice for the PLA.37 China has also invited other
countries to attend its military exercises and has observed major Western
military exercises, such as U.S. Pacific Command’s 2006 Valiant
Shield exercise off Guam.38<br><br>
As part of its military diplomacy, China continues to export conventional
weapons to a regular collection of small countries in Asia
(e.g., Burma, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Thailand), sub-Saharan Africa
(e.g., Sudan and Zimbabwe), and the Middle East (e.g., Algeria, Egypt,
and Iran). Globally, China’s annual arms deliveries have remained at
a limited level for the past decade, between $500 million to $1 billion
per year. This ranks China as the fifth- or sixth-largest exporter
to developing nations, and its share of the global market has remained
between 3 and 5 percent (albeit with an uptick to almost 7 percent
in 2007). U.S. and Russian arms exports dominate the global market
(Figure 5.6).<br><br>

Chinese arms exports are not a major source of political influence
for China but rather reflect the buyers’ lack of access to other suppliers
or their lack of funds. The continued lack of appeal of China’s
inexpensive but often unreliable weapon systems reduces China’s ability
to use such deals to forge long-term strategic relations with countries
that have access to more advanced systems on the global arms
market. China’s long-standing defense industrial relationship with
Pakistan is a partial exception. China’s weapons are most appealing
to two categories of states: small, poor countries (mainly in Africa)
who cannot afford more advanced systems, and countries such as Burma and Sudan whose access to the global arms market is restricted.<br><br>
As a result, China has sold to the same set of countries for the last
decade, with the occasional one-off deals. The limited competitiveness
of Chinese arms exports could change if, in the coming years, China
develops next-generation systems and then decides to export the more
advanced weapon systems that currently populate the PLA’s arsenal. If
this shift occurred, then arms sales could become a more significant
part of China’s security cooperation with other countries and a source
of political influence. <br><br>
