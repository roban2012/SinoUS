	Chapter SEVEN Challenges Facing Chinese Diplomacy
	</font>	
	</center>

	<font size=5>
	<br><br>

Beijing confronts several challenges to achieving its five foreign policy
objectives. Some of them stem from domestic circumstances that constrain
effective statecraft, and others stem from external reactions to
China’s growing capabilities. China’s ability to manage these challenges
will serve as an important indicator of its diplomatic power and
influence.<br><br>
Domestic Transition and Foreign Policy Decisionmaking
In examining the evolution of China’s international behavior, one consideration
is central: China is experiencing far-reaching changes in
its economic, social, and―to a limited degree―political affairs. The
resulting shifts in the structure and functioning of the Chinese economy,
society, and polity are affecting the substance of its foreign policy
and related decisionmaking processes. The influence of these internal
dynamics on China’s international behavior is substantial and will only
strengthen in the future.<br><br>
The linkages in China between foreign policy and domestic
social, economic, and political transformation are difficult to specify
and quantify, but they regularly manifest themselves. Some recent
examples include the influence of corporate interest groups and nationalist
sentiments (e.g., national oil companies and anti-Japan nationalist groups) on foreign policymaking.1 Given the brittle legitimacy of the
Communist Party, Chinese leaders can no longer pursue policies with
minimal regard for the views of interest groups (both those within
and those outside the CCP) or public opinion. Popular sentiments can
and have constrained the foreign policy decisions of Chinese leaders,
especially when such popular views on controversial foreign policy
questions are used as instruments by those in the highest levels of the
Chinese Communist Party to jockey for power among a “collective
leadership.” Such policy opportunism for narrow political gain within
the CCP has been common among China’s top leaders for decades―it
may be even more so today given that no individual Chinese leader has
supreme authority.2<br><br>
In this period of rapid social and economic transition, a related
challenge for Chinese policymakers is how to accurately assess the
domestic costs and benefits of foreign policy decisions. As China’s economic
reforms evolve and Chinese industry and society diversify, it
is becoming increasingly difficult for Chinese policymakers to conduct
cost-benefit types of calculations regarding policy decisions. This occurs because policymakers are often unaware of all the stakeholders
in China (with views on specific foreign policy issues) and their
respective equities, which are constantly changing as well. According
to interviews with Chinese policymakers and scholars, this situation
has significantly complicated the foreign policy decisionmaking process
in China under Hu Jintao and led to Hu’s efforts to improve interagency
coordination on all types of foreign policy-related decisions, at
both the central and provincial levels of government.3<br><br>
Thus, the scope and pace of China’s domestic transition in the
coming years will continue to create conditions under which foreign
policymaking could appear to foreign observers as uncoordinated, irrational,
unpredictable, and perhaps even erratic. China’s seemingly frenzied
global search for oil supplies in the 2003C2006 time frame serves
as one recent example of this phenomenon.4<br><br>

These observations are meant to highlight a general and seemingly
growing constraint on China’s pursuit of its international interests. For
foreign analysts of China, these observations provide a lens through
which to evaluate future trends in China’s international behavior by
underscoring the importance of understanding the domestic context of
decisionmaking when making analytic judgments about China’s foreign
policy motives.<br><br>
Looming Challenges<br><br>
Beijing confronts several additional challenges to effective pursuit of
its international interests. First, Chinese leaders will likely face rising
expectations from other states, if this is not already occurring. In the
past, China has benefited from low expectation about its behaviors (e.g.,
its response to the 1997 Asian financial crisis), and now expectations of
both China’s involvement and its contributions to global economic and
security affairs are growing.<br><br>
	
As China’s global profile grows and, in Asia, as Beijing continues
to position itself as central to economic and security affairs, China’s
neighbors and members of the international community will expect
more of Beijing, especially as it proclaims itself to be a “responsible
major power” engaged in a “peaceful rise.” In the past, China has benefited
from relatively low expectations about its behavior, but now the
pendulum is swinging in the other direction.<br><br>
It is not clear that China has the intention or capacity to consistently
meet such expectations or that China’s expectations will match
those of its neighbors. Many leaders in Asia are wondering whether
China’s “rise” will really be peaceful. China’s role in regional security
is already the subject of some apprehension among East Asian states,
and its ongoing military modernization may enhance such anxieties.5<br><br>
Is China willing to contribute “public goods” to the region or make the
types of costly decisions that will help maintain regional stability? As
China’s stakes in regional stability in Asia and other regions grow, it
may make such investments. But Chinese leaders have provided only
limited indications of their willingness to define their national interests
in a way that may sacrifice short-term gains for the sake of mediumto
long-term benefits to regional stability. On the one hand, China’s
increase in development and humanitarian aid is a sign of Beijing’s
desire to make such contributions. Beyond Asia, China’s 2008 military
deployment of three ships to the international antipiracy effort in the
Gulf of Aden is a high-profile example of China trying to act “responsibly”
and contribute to a global security effort. On the other hand, the
business practices of some Chinese state-run companies, especially in
Africa, have generated concerns among regional nations that China is
more self-interested and less supportive of regional development.<br><br>
Related to the above constraint, to what extent will China’s compliance
with its numerous (and growing) trade and security commitments
raise concerns about its ability to be a trusted rising power?<br><br>
China’s compliance will be an important indicator of its intentions.<br><br>

Beijing’s mixed history of meeting its international trade, nonproliferation,
and human rights pledges suggests this will be a problem China
needs to manage.6 China’s interpretation of some of its trade commitments
has already resulted in frictions with ASEAN nations and economic
partners in Africa.7 China’s relations with these and other countries
may be damaged if they begin to question China’s reliability and,
ultimately, its intentions.<br><br>
Second, China’s approach to the Taiwan question complicates
Beijing’s image. Beijing’s occasionally confrontational and aggressive
approach with other states on Taiwan issues reveals the limits of
its effort to appear moderate and benign. Although this behavior is
less frequent than before, there are several prominent examples of it
in this decade. In 2004, Chinese officials publicly lambasted Singapore’s
incoming Prime Minister Lee Hsien Long, before he had taken
office, about a pending visit to Taiwan and then berated him following
his trip. China then halted all high-level dialogues with Singapore
for two years. In March 2005, a Chinese diplomat publicly demanded
that Australia recuse itself from involvement in a military conflict over
Taiwan, despite Canberra’s commitments to Washington through the
AustraliaCNew ZealandC
United States Security Treaty. China’s passage
of the Anti-Secession Law in spring 2005 contributed to the decisions
in many European capitals to defer an impending EU decision
about lifting its 1989 arms embargo on China. In spring 2006, China’s
thenCambassador to South Korea, Ning Fukuai, publicly advised
South Korean officials to restrict the role of U.S. military forces based
in Korea to the defense of Korea and not to allow them to be used
for regional contingencies (e.g., Taiwan). This sparked Korean sensitivities
to China’s meddling in alliance politics, contributing to current
debates about South Korea’s need to reduce its economic dependence
on China.8<br><br>

Such actions and statements from Beijing present China’s “rise”
in a less benign light, and regularly remind states of China’s willingness
to engage in coercive diplomacy. Ultimately, any Chinese use of
force (limited or major) to address the Taiwan question would heighten
latent concerns, especially among Southeast Asian nations with a history
of Chinese interference and coercion, that China’s ascension in
regional affairs could threaten their own security interests.<br><br>
Third, China’s acute governance challenges are directly and indirectly
affecting external perceptions of China, and negatively so.9 China’s
most severe governance problems―such as systemic corruption,
increasing center-periphery tensions, weak environmental controls, a
decrepit health care system, and growing nationalism―hinder Beijing’s
ability to control the multiple actors in China’s large economy
and expansive party-state bureaucracy. These weaknesses constrain
the government’s ability to effectively manage internal problems that
could spill over to China’s neighbors. Beijing’s initially slow and dismissive
response to the spread of SARS in southern China highlighted
to Southeast Asian governments the degree to which China’s public
health crises and environmental problems can threaten their economies
because of Beijing’s negligence. In late 2005, the Chinese government’s
failure to rapidly control the chemical contamination of the
Songhua River in northeastern China resulted in the spill flowing into
Russia. Examples abound of foreign countries’ concerns about China’s
inability to meet various commitments as a result of corruption, centerperiphery
tensions, and generally underdeveloped government controls
in certain sectors.<br><br>
A fourth challenge stems from weaknesses in China’s national
security decisionmaking system, especially those related to crisis decisionmaking.
China’s bureaucracy for making national security decisions
is plagued with the problems of excessive secrecy; divisions
between the civilian, intelligence, and military decisionmaking structures;
and the lack of ways to coordinate among civilian and military organizations.10 Prominent manifestations of these weaknesses include
the slow and haphazard national response to the SARS episode, the
prominence of the PLA narrative in the EP-3 incident in April 2001,
and the slow response and vague explanation about the January 2007
test of a direct ascent antisatellite weapon. These limitations will likely
become even more problematic as the PLA improves its capabilities and
conducts military activities beyond China’s immediate periphery, such
as submarine patrols, which will raise questions about China’s regional
ambitions.<br><br>
A fifth challenge is China’s possession and mobilization of
sufficient national resources to play a more active role in East Asia―
especially when compared to the resources of the United States and
its allies. Although its diplomatic toolkit is expanding, China is still
limited in the national resources it can use and is willing to mobilize to
pursue its diplomatic agenda. The most obvious example of this constraint
was the comparatively small amount of aid that China donated
to tsunami victims in Southeast Asia in early 2005. China provided
$83 million worth of financial and material support. Although this
was the greatest amount of humanitarian aid China has ever provided,
it paled in comparison to the hundreds of millions of dollars that the
United States, Australia, and Japan spent on relief operations. Also,
the collective military logistics capability of the U.S. military and its
Asian allies (mainly India and Japan) to deliver such aid far outstrips
anything that China currently possesses.<br><br>
Sixth, as China “goes global” with its overseas investment and
purchasing of natural resources, Beijing risks being seen as an extractive
economy, taking much from developing nations and contributing
little to their national development. Given the modes of operations
of many Chinese companies operating abroad, in which they import
Chinese labor and goods for local infrastructure projects, China is
increasingly facing this very challenge. Such sentiments have already been raised in several Latin American and African nations.11 This perception
of China, if it develops further, could undermine a core feature
of China’s international behavior: its identity as a fellow developing
nation that has long opposed such “neo-colonialist” practices as
resource exploitation.<br><br>
A final diplomatic challenge for Chinese leaders is the constraining
effect of nationalist sentiments on foreign policy choices. Although
Chinese leaders have used nationalist sentiment as a tool to shape the
domestic context of policy decisions, they face the inherent constraints
of trying to manipulate nationalism. The growth of anti-Japanese
sentiments in China, in particular, has limited the ability of Chinese
policymakers to pursue a more balanced approach to the Sino-Japanese
relationship―one that better reflects Beijing’s economic and security
interests in stable and amicable relations with Tokyo. In periods of
bilateral crises with Japan, the United States, or other nations, nationalist
protests have had and will continue to have a corrosive effect on the
government’s ability to de-escalate the situation and reach resolution.<br><br>
To be sure, Chinese leaders appear to have begun to recognize
this constraint, and they now pay attention to managing public perceptions.<br><br>
In recent years foreign ministry and CCP statements about
foreign affairs work have become replete with references to the importance
of “people-centered” diplomacy and “balancing the overall international
and domestic situations,” which are both references to avoiding
public opposition to key foreign policy decisions, including by
providing opportunities for input.12 <br><br>
