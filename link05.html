	Chapter Five China＊s Space Capabilities
	</font>	
	</center>

	<font size=5>
	<br><br>

Like aviation technologies, many space technologies are inherently
dual-use. The development of capabilities to produce civilian space systems,
therefore, contributes to China＊s capability to produce military
space systems. Launch vehicles can be used to launch military as well
as civilian satellites, and communications, weather, earth-observation,
and navigation satellites can be used for military or civilian purposes.
Military missiles, even ballistic missiles, generally use different types
of rocket motors and launch methods than space launch vehicles, but
certain components, such as guidance and control systems, may be
similar.<br><br>
Foreign involvement in China＊s space industry is significantly
less than in the aviation manufacturing industry. China is not closely
integrated into the supply chains of foreign space companies, and the
market for Chinese products and services such as space launches and
satellites is small. Although China＊s space launch vehicles were originally
based on ballistic-missile technology transferred from the Soviet
Union, China has advanced far beyond that technology through its own
efforts, and foreign assistance has been limited. Chinese space companies
have received technical assistance from foreign entities in some
specific areas, such as Russian assistance in the area of manned spaceflight,
Brazilian assistance in the development of earth-observation
satellites, German assistance in the development of communications
satellites, and U.S. assistance in launch-vehicle technology. In most
cases, however, the advancement of China＊s space technology has been
the result of purely domestic efforts.<br><br>

China has made significant progress in advancing its space capabilities
over the past decade and is making concerted efforts to further
expand them. All relevant metrics reveal an accelerating growth trend
in the country＊s civilian and military space program development. In
83 known spacecraft launches between October 20, 1996, and June
15, 2010, Chinese launch vehicles experienced only one failure〞an
incomplete burn of a third stage that resulted in an Indonesian communications
satellite being put in the wrong orbit in August 2009
(※Long March [Chang Zheng],§ 2010). The 83 launches included three
successful launches of manned spacecraft, the most recent of which, in
September 2008, involved a spacewalk, and two lunar orbiters (※Shenzhou
Series,§ 2009; ※Chang＊e Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
China＊s government is trying to promote China＊s growth as a provider
of commercial space products and services. In the 1990s, China
emerged as a major provider of commercial launch services with its
Chang Zheng (※Long March§) series of launch vehicles. From 1990 to
1999, Chinese rockets launched nearly 30 satellites for customers based
outside of mainland China. In the late 1990s, however, several Chang
Zheng launches failed, and it was revealed that U.S. satellite companies
had provided technical assistance to Chinese launch-vehiclemakers
(who also make missiles for the Chinese military and for
export), resulting in tightened U.S. restrictions on China launching
satellites that contain U.S. technology. As a consequence, only a handful
of launches have been conducted for customers based outside of
mainland China since 1999 (※Long March [Chang Zheng],§ 2010).<br><br>
Recently, however, China has developed a domestically designed communications
satellite, the European company EADS Astrium has
developed a communications satellite that contains no U.S. technology,
and as noted above, Chinese launch vehicles have established a
remarkable record for reliability since 1996. As a result, the appeal of
Chinese space products and services in markets outside the United
States is probably increasing. China＊s 11th Five-Year Plan, which ended
in 2010, called for the greater integration of market mechanisms into
the space program to foster competition and to generate products and
services that could earn China a larger share of the global commercial
space-systems market (※Aerospace Development 11th 5-Year Plan§).<br><br>

A separate policy document, the ※National Guidance for
Medium- and Long-Term Plans for Science and Technology Development
(2006每2020),§ outlines further goals for the Chinese aerospace
industry. Objectives listed in the document include developing
nontoxic, pollution-free, high-performance, low-cost, powerful-thrust
launch vehicles capable of carrying 25-ton payloads into low earth orbit
(LEO) and 14-ton payloads into geostationary orbit (GEO)1; developing
a 120-ton-thrust liquid-oxygen/kerosene engine and a 50-tonthrust
hydrogen-oxygen engine; improving and developing remotesensing
satellites and associated ground stations; further developing
communications- and broadcast-satellite technologies; pushing toward
commercialization of communications- and broadcast-satellite services;
increasing the number and quality of space technology experiments;
and developing a deep space telescope (※China＊s Space Activities
in 2006,§ 2006).<br><br>
China has maintained a relatively high launch tempo of about
one launch every two months, on average, for the past decade and is
steadily increasing its total number of orbiting operational satellites. At
the end of 2002, China had nine satellites in orbit (Guo, 2002). Today,
it has an estimated 55 operational satellites, not including communications
satellites owned and operated out of Hong Kong. Additionally,
since 2002, there have been five recoverable photoreconnaissance satellite
missions, three manned missions (manned spaceflight program),
and two lunar observation missions, and a commercial communications
satellite was successfully built and launched for Venezuela (※UCS
Satellite Database§; ※Long March [Chang Zheng],§ 2010; ※Chang＊e
Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
Nonetheless, China＊s space program has encountered significant
technical problems, particularly with satellites. China＊s domestically
designed high-capacity communications satellite platform, called Dongfanghong 4 (DFH-4), has experienced multiple failures. The
Huanjing series of environmental and disaster-monitoring satellites
and the Haiyang series of oceanographic satellites, although they have
experienced no known failures, are being deployed more slowly than
originally announced. Three out of 10 Beidou-series PNT satellites
have also experienced technical problems. It is not clear whether these
problems are due to underlying design issues, insufficient quality control
in construction, or simple poor luck, but China＊s space capabilities
will probably not develop as quickly as outlined in the ※National Guidance
for Medium- and Long-Term Plans for Science and Technology
Development (2006每2020).§ Nonetheless, comparison with the successes
of China＊s space program suggests that any technical problems
will be overcome eventually. The ultimate effect on U.S. national security
will be the same, but that effect might not emerge as quickly as
current plans would imply.<br><br>
Despite some technical setbacks, Chinese satellites now provide
increasingly sophisticated intelligence, surveillance, and navigation
capabilities that have significantly advanced China＊s military capabilities.
Though the capabilities of the satellites fall short of U.S. standards,
they are more than sufficient for most military purposes. China＊s
commercial space prospects seem more limited given extensive foreign
competition, but its space launch program has achieved a number of
successes that make it potentially appealing to other countries interested
in launching commercial satellites.<br><br>
Launch Vehicles<br><br>
All of China＊s operational space launches have been performed by the
Chang Zheng (CZ) family of rockets, although China is apparently
developing a family of small solid-fuel launchers called Kaituozhe (Pioneer).<br><br>
The design of the CZ family was based on the Dongfeng series
of ballistic missiles developed in the 1960s. The first CZ rockets were
launched in 1969 (that rocket failed), 1970, and 1971 from Jiuquan
Space Launch Center. There are currently three operational series of
CZ missiles: CZ-2, CZ-3, and CZ-4. All use liquid-bipropellant-fueled engines, and all can be launched from one of China＊s three currently
operational launch sites. The most powerful versions are capable of
carrying at least 8,000 kg (the weight of the Shenzhou manned space
modules) into LEO and more than 5,000 kg into GEO. As of June
2010, there had been 125 launches of the CZ series (※Long March
[Chang Zheng],§ 2010; ※Shenzhou Series,§ 2009).<br><br>
The next generation of CZ rockets, the CZ-5 series, is currently
under development and is expected to enter service by 2014. The CZ-5
is being manufactured in Tianjin and will be delivered by sea to the
Wenchang Space Launch Center, which is currently under construction
on Hainan Island. The CZ-5 will use nontoxic fuels and is intended to
be able to lift 25-metric-ton payloads into LEO and 14-ton payloads
into GEO (※Long March 5 [CZ-5] Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
The Kaituozhe is a solid-fuel rocket based on the Dongfeng-21
ballistic missile. Development of the launch vehicle began in 2000.<br><br>
Three versions〞KT-1, KT-2, and KT-2A〞are reportedly in development.<br><br>
The KT-1 is believed to have flown at least five times, but at least
two of the test flights were failures (※Kaituozhe Series,§ 2010). At one
time, the launch vehicle＊s manufacturer, China Aerospace Science and
Industry Corporation (CASIC), was actively marketing the Kaituozhe,
but as of October 2010, no reference to it could be found on CASIC＊s
website.<br><br>
Satellites<br><br>
Communications Satellites<br><br>
Currently, about nine operational commercial communications satellites
are owned and operated by organizations based in mainland China
(another two or three are owned and operated by companies based in
Hong Kong). Only two of these satellites, however, were manufactured
by Chinese companies. China also operates two military communications
satellites and one data-relay satellite, all of which were manufactured
by Chinese companies (※UCS Satellite Database§). <br><br>


Dongfanghong 3<br><br>
Dongfanghong (※East is Red§) 3 (DFH 3) is a medium-capacity communications
satellite built by the Chinese Academy of Space Technology
(CAST), a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Technology
Corporation (CASC), a state-owned company. The first DFH 3 was
orbited in 1994 (※Long March [Chang Zheng],§ 2010). Four satellites
based on this design are currently in operation: ChinaSat 5C, a commercial
communications satellite; Fenghuo and Shentong, military
communications satellites; and Tianlian, a data-relay satellite.<br><br>
ChinaSat 5C, formerly known as Sinosat 3 or Xinnuo 3, was
launched on May 31, 2007. It is operated by China Satellite Communications
Corporation (China Satcom), a subsidiary of CASC, and carries
10 C-band transponders that provide television services throughout
China (※ChinaSat 5C§).<br><br>
Fenghuo and Shentong are dedicated military communications
satellites. Fenghuo, officially known as Zhongxing 22 or China-
Sat 22, was reportedly developed by CAST to support a theater-level
command, control, communications, and intelligence network called
Qudian. The first Fenghuo satellite, Fenghuo 1, was launched in January
2000. A replacement, Fenghuo 1A (Zhongxing 22A/ChinaSat
22A), was launched in September 2006. The original Fenghuo appears
to no longer be functional. Fenghuo 1A provides secure voice and
data communications (※Feng Huo [Zhongxing 2X/ShenTong Series],§
2010; ※UCS Satellite Database§).<br><br>
Shentong, officially known as Zhongxing 20 or ChinaSat 20, is
described as a ※strategic communications§ satellite and was launched in
November 2003. It is reportedly the first Chinese satellite to use multiple
steerable Ku-band spot-beam antenna technology, which enables
ground users to communicate at high data rates while on the move, and
the first to use secured uplink transmission for satellite antenna control;
it reportedly has China＊s most powerful onboard data-processing
capability (※Feng Huo [Zhongxing 2X/ShenTong Series],§ 2010).<br><br>
China launched its first data-relay satellite, Tianlian 1, in April
2008, putting it into GEO at 77 degrees east. Tianlian is based on
a DFH-3 bus. It was launched in preparation for the Shenzhou 7
manned mission, which occurred in September 2008, and is reportedly the first in a new network that will augment or replace China＊s current
ground-based space-tracking and telemetry stations and space-tracking
ships. Tianlian is referred to as a ※space station§ for relaying data
(※China Sets Up First Space Station for Spacecraft Data Relay,§ 2008).
China＊s space-tracking ships and ground stations were able to cover
only 12 percent of Shenzhou 7＊s orbit, according to Zhang Jianqi, a top
Chinese space official quoted by Xinhua (※China Blasts Off First Data
Relay Satellite,§ 2008).<br><br>
In addition to providing communications with manned spacecraft,
data-relay satellites can also provide relay services for other satellites.
Because of the curvature of the earth, a satellite in LEO at an
altitude of 600 km, such as China＊s Yaogan series of military reconnaissance
satellites, can communicate only with ground sites within about
2,800 km of its location. If there are no ground stations within that
distance at the time the satellite collects an image, it must store the data
until it comes within range of a ground station. For example, a Chinese
reconnaissance satellite passing over Guam would have to store any
images it collected until it passed within range of a Chinese ground
station. A satellite in GEO, however, can communicate with a ground
station or other satellite virtually anywhere on about one-third of the
earth＊s surface. Thus, a reconnaissance satellite in LEO could transmit
images it collects up to a satellite in GEO, which could then immediately
relay them back down to a ground station in China, where
they could be processed (if the reconnaissance satellite was far away
from China, more than one relay satellite might be needed). Tianlian
1 is located off the southern tip of India and thus is not ideally positioned
to act as a relay for Chinese satellites passing over the western
Pacific region, but in the future, China will likely deploy additional
relay satellites.<br><br>
Dongfanghong 4<br><br>
Dongfanghong 4 is a high-capacity communications satellite, also
built by CAST. This design has experienced significant technical problems.<br><br>
The first example, SinoSat 2, was built for Sino Satellite Communications,
a Chinese state-owned company now absorbed into China
Satcom. Sinosat 2 was launched in October 2006, but its solar panels failed to deploy, and the satellite was a total loss. The second example,
NigcomSat, was built for the Nigerian government and launched in
May 2007. The drive on one of its solar arrays failed, and the satellite
is apparently no longer operational. The third example, Venesat 1,
was built for the Venezuelan government. It was launched in October
2008 and is apparently operating normally. The fourth and most recent
example, ChinaSat 6A (also called Sinosat 6), was launched on September
4, 2010, to act as a backup for ChinaSat 5C (described above).
However, ChinaSat 6A suffered a leak in its helium-pressurization
system that will likely shorten its operational life from a design goal
of 15 years to at most 10 years (Covault, 2006; ※NigComSat,§ 2010;
※UCS Satellite Database§; ※Venesat (Simon Bolivar),§ 2010; ※Chinasat/
Zhongxing/STTW Series,§ 2010; de Selding, 2010).<br><br>
Weather Satellites<br><br>
China launched its first weather satellite, Fengyun 1A, in 1988. Since
that time, it has launched 10 additional Fengyun (※Wind and Cloud§)
satellites of increasing capability. As of July 2010, five of these were
apparently still operational: Fengyun 1D, 2C, 2D, 2E, and 3A.2<br><br>
Fengyun 1D is in a polar LEO and has a 10-channel radiometer operating
in the visible and infrared bands for observation of clouds, land
surfaces, and oceans. Fengyun 2C, 2D, and 2E are in GEO and carry
radiometers operating in five channels (※Fengyun Series,§ 2010; ※UCS
Satellite Database§).<br><br>
Fengyun 3A, launched in May 2008, is the first of a new generation
of polar weather satellites that is much more capable than the
Fengyun 1 series. It carries a 10-channel scanning radiometer, infrared
and microwave radiometers, a space environment monitor, and an
earth-radiation scanning radiometer. It provides images with a spatial
resolution of 250 m and temperature accuracy of 0.1∼F. Two more satellites
in the Fengyun 3 series were expected to be launched in 2008,
but as of July 2010, only Fengyun 3A was in orbit. The reasons for the
delay are unclear (※Fengyun Series,§ 2010; ※UCS Satellite Database§). <br><br>

China is also developing a Fengyun 4 series GEO satellite to
replace the Fengyun 2 series. Reportedly, there will be an optical
series and a microwave series. The launch of the first optical satellite
is expected in 2012, followed by two more in 2015, then two more in
2019. The first of the microwave series is scheduled for 2015, followed
by another in 2018 and a third in 2022 (※Fengyun Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
Weather satellites have both civilian and military utility. Knowing
and predicting weather can be crucial to successful military operations.<br><br>
Indeed, China＊s military reportedly plans to use the Fengyun 3
satellites for military weather forecasting, and the United States still
maintains its own Defense Meteorology Satellite Program satellites.
Weather satellite data is increasingly a global public good, and China,
as a member of the World Meteorological Organization, has access
to data from other countries＊ civilian weather satellites. Having its
own weather satellites, however, provides China with a hedge against
a cutoff of this information in the event of a confrontation with the
United Sates or other countries (※Fengyun Series,§ 2010; ※Defense
Meteorology Satellite Program [DMSP] Series,§ 2009).<br><br>
Civilian Earth-Observation Satellites<br><br>
China operates three series of earth-observation satellites that are primarily
or exclusively civilian in purpose. The oldest series is the China-
Brazil Earth Resources Satellites (CBERS) series, jointly developed
with Brazil. China also operates the Haiyang series of oceanographic
satellites and the Huanjing series of environmental and disaster-monitoring
satellites.<br><br>
CBERS<br><br>
The stated mission of the CBERS is to provide imagery of the earth＊s
surface for applications including agriculture, environmental protection,
hydrological and ocean resources, forestry, and geology. Three
CBERS have been launched since 1999. At the moment, apparently
only the third, CBERS 2B, launched in September 2007, remains in
operation, but at least two additional satellites are planned. The satellites
have multisensor payloads with different spatial resolutions and
image-collecting frequencies, including a wide field imager (WFI), a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera, and a high-resolution panchromatic
(i.e., black-and-white) camera (HRC).3 Brazil developed the
WFI, while China developed the CCD camera and the HRC.4 The
onboard WFI has a ground swath of 890 km at a spatial resolution
of 260 m in two spectral bands. The CCD camera provides images
of a 113-km-wide swath with 20-m spatial resolution in five spectral
bands and is capable of taking stereoscopic images. The HRC provides
images of a swath 27 km wide with a resolution of 2.7 m. Images from
the WFI and CCD cameras are available to the public; images from
the HRC are not (※China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellites [CBERS]/
Ziyuan Series,§ 2009; ※Zi Yuan CBERS [China-Brazil Earth Resources
Satellite],§; ※CBERS: China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite§).<br><br>
Images with 20-m resolution, such as those provided by the CCD
camera on CBERS 2B, are too coarse to be militarily useful, but images
with 2.7-m resolution, such as those provided by the HRC, can be
militarily useful. For example, 2.7-m resolution is sufficient to identify
ship or aircraft types and thus would enable an analyst to determine
whether a ship was an aircraft carrier or a cargo ship, or whether fighter
aircraft were present at an airbase. Thus, it is interesting that images
from the HRC, unlike those from the WFI and CCD camera, are not
publicly available.<br><br>
Huanjing<br><br>
The Huanjing (※Environment§) series satellites are described as environmental
and disaster-monitoring small satellites. Two of a planned
11 had been launched as of July 2010. Both were launched atop a single
launch vehicle in September 2008, and both are equipped with a CCD
camera of 20-m resolution. Huanjing 1A also carries a multispectral
(visible and infrared) radiometer with 100-m resolution. Huanjing
1B carries an infrared camera with 150-m resolution. A third satellite,
Huanjing 1C, which was expected to launch in 2010, carries an
S-band (2每4 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capable of seeing
through clouds and at night with a resolution of 20 m. As noted above, images of 20-m resolution have limited military utility. Thus, the current
Huanjing satellites cannot make a significant contribution to China＊s
military capabilities (※UCS Satellite Database§; ※Huanjing Series,§
2010).<br><br>
Haiyang<br><br>
The Haiyang (※Oceans§) series satellites are officially ocean-observation
satellites intended for monitoring of oceanic resources, port building,
and environmental and pollution study. Currently, the second satellite
in the series, Haiyang 1B, launched in April 2007, is operational. The
first, Haiyang 1A, was launched in 2002 and is no longer operational.<br><br>
Haiyang 1B carries a 10-channel infrared scanner with resolution of
1.1 km and a four-band CCD camera with maximum resolution of
250 m. These satellites are controlled by the State Oceanic Administration
and have little or no military utility, but reportedly a Haiyang 2
series and Haiyang 3 series are under development. Instruments carried
by the Haiyang 2 series will include an altimeter to measure sea
surface height, which, depending on the capability of the instrument,
could theoretically be used to attempt to detect the presence of submerged
submarines. The Haiyang 3 series, the first of which is expected
to be launched in 2012, will reportedly carry a radar that operates in
the X-band (8每12 GHz) and is capable of obtaining images of land and
ocean features (e.g., ships) with resolution as fine as 1 m. The Haiyang
program appears to be behind schedule, however. The first satellite of
the Haiyang 2 series (Haiyang 2A) was originally said to be planned
for launch in 2009. As of July 2010, however, only Haiyang 1B was
in orbit (※UCS Satellite Database§; ※Haiyang Series,§ 2010; Pollpeter,
2008, p. 21).<br><br>
Military Imagery Reconnaissance Satellites
China has three series of military imagery satellites. The oldest are the
Fanhui Shi Weixing (FSW) recoverable film satellites. These have been
followed by the Ziyuan and, most recently, Yaogan series. <br><br>

FSW<br><br>
Five different models of FSW (※Recoverable Satellite§) satellites have
been developed (corresponding to the military designators Jianbing 1,
2, and 4). The first launch was attempted in 1974, but it failed. The
first successful launch took place in 1975. Since that time, 21 additional
missions have been flown, the most recent in 2005. The most
recent missions lasted 18 to 27 days. Presumably, the advantage of the
FSW satellites, even though China is now able to produce satellites
with high-resolution CCD cameras, is that the shortness of the mission
dictated by the limited quantity of film that can be carried allows
the satellites to be flown in lower, quickly decaying orbits. For example,
as noted above, the Yaogan series orbit above 600 km. The most
recent series of FSW missions, by contrast, flew in orbits that varied
between about 200 km and 320 km, or between 165 km and 550 km.
Orbits this low cannot be maintained for long periods of time because
of the atmospheric drag, but since the film in the cameras is apparently
exhausted after 18 to 27 days, this is not a problem for the FSW series.
And since resolution is a linear function of range, a satellite orbiting at
300-km altitude can collect images with twice as high resolution as a
satellite orbiting at 600-km altitude (※Fanhui Shi Weixing 3 [FSW-3]/
JianBing-4 Series,§ 2010).<br><br>




Ziyuan<br><br>
Three satellites in the Ziyuan (※Resources§) series have been launched,
the first in September 2000 and the last in November 2004. They are
officially the Chinese domestic equivalent of the CBERS series and
are said to be designed for civilian roles such as territorial surveying,
environment monitoring, city planning, crop-yield assessment, disaster
monitoring, and space-science experimentation. However, the Chinese
government has never released any information concerning their
design or the imaging systems they carry, and they are believed to in
fact be military imagery reconnaissance satellites with the military
designation JianBing-3. All three are believed to carry CCD cameras
with approximately 3-m resolution and infrared multispectral scanners.
They reportedly have design lives of two to four years, but as of July 2010, all three were apparently still in operation (※UCS Satellite
Database§; ※ZiYuan-2/JianBing-3 Series,§ 2010).<br><br>



Yaogan<br><br>
Yaogan (※Remote Sensing§) is China＊s most recent generation of imagery
reconnaissance satellites. It appears to comprise at least two types〞SAR
satellites (military designator JianBing 5) and optical-reconnaissance
satellites (military designator JianBing 6)〞and possibly a third type,
an ocean-surveillance satellite.<br><br>
Ten Yaogan satellites have been launched to date. Yaogan 1,
launched in April 2006, was China＊s first SAR-equipped satellite. Since
that time, three additional SAR satellites in the Yaogan series have been
launched: Yaogan 3, 5, and 10. The satellites＊ radar reportedly operates
in the L-band (1每2 GHz) and has resolution as low as 5 m. Yaogan 1
apparently broke up in February 2010, but Yaogan 3, 5, and 10 remain
operational (※Yaogan Series,§ 2010; ※UCS Satellite Database§).<br><br>




Yaogan 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are believed to be optical-reconnaissance
satellites with resolution of possibly 0.8 m. Yaogan 2 was launched in
May 2007, and all five of these satellites are apparently still operational
(※Yaogan Series,§ 2010; ※UCS Satellite Database§).<br><br>
Yaogan 9, launched in March 2010, may be an ocean-reconnaissance
satellite. It consists of a main satellite and two subsatellites in

nearly identical orbits. This configuration resembles that of the U.S.
Navy＊s Naval Ocean Surveillance Satellite system. The satellites reportedly
carry infrared sensors to detect ships and antennas to pick up electronic


emissions. The use of three satellites would enable the location of
an electronic emitter to be determined through triangulation (Parsons,
2010, p. 14; ※Yaogan Series,§ 2010).<br><br>


Position, Navigation, and Timing Satellites<br><br>
The impetus for developing an indigenous PNT system was first military,
then commercial. Many Chinese weapon systems use GPS to
increase their accuracy, but Chinese military leaders, fearing that GPS
could be degraded or shut down in a conflict, concluded that they
needed their own independent PNT system (Pollpeter, 2007). <br><br>



The Beidou (※Northern Dipper§)/Compass system is China＊s
indigenously developed PNT satellite system. It is intended to serve as
an alternative to GPS, the Russian Glonass, and the European Galileo
system. In 2000, China launched the first satellites of a first-generation
PNT constellation using satellites in GEO. The system provided coverage
only over East Asia, positioning accuracy was only about 100 m,
and, because the system required two-way communication between
the users and a central control station, the user equipment was bulkier
and required greater power than the U.S. GPS system, in which the
user equipment consists of passive receivers (※Beidou/Compass Series,§
2010).A lthough two of the original Beidou satellites remain operational
(Beidou 1B and 1C), in 2007, China began deploying the first satellites
of a second-generation system, called Compass or Beidou 2. This
system, like GPS, will be a one-way passive system with global coverage.<br><br>
Unlike GPS, however, which includes only satellites in medium
earth orbit (MEO), Compass will include satellites in a combination
of MEO and geosynchronous orbit (GSO).5 The system will provide
commercial customers with positioning accuracy to within 10 m and
timing accuracy (needed for the synchronization of automated datalinks)
to within 10 nanosec. Greater accuracy will be available to
Chinese military users (※UCS Satellite Database§; ※Beidou/Compass
Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
By August 2010, four operational Beidou 2 satellites were in orbit
(one in inclined GSO, two in GEO, and one in MEO). Twelve satellites
are planned to be in orbit by 2012, providing a regional navigation
system covering China and its neighboring areas. A complete system
of 35 satellites is intended to be in place by 2020. These will include
five satellites in GEO, 27 in MEO, and three in inclined GSO (※UCS
Satellite Database§; ※Beidou/Compass Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
The satellites appear to be experiencing technical problems.<br><br>
In February 2007, one of the four first-generation Beidou satellites (Beidou 1D) experienced an explosion while transiting to GEO, then



it had trouble deploying its solar panels after reaching GEO. Finally, in
February 2009, its orbit was raised by 130 km in an apparent attempt
to place it in a ※graveyard§ orbit (an orbit in which nonfunctional satellites
are placed, where they will not interfere with operational satellites).<br><br>
The first of the new generation of geostationary spacecraft
(Beidou 2B/Compass G2) apparently lost control after being launched
in April 2009. In April 2010, an analysis was published stating that
there were frequent spikes in the signal from the first MEO Compass
satellite, suggesting that there is a problem on the satellite. Thus, three
out of nine Beidou satellites launched so far have experienced technical
problems (※Beidou/Compass Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
Commercial applications of Beidou are also having trouble getting
off the ground. A receiver unit for the first-generation Beidou
system costs about $2,500, more than 10 times the cost of a GPS unit
(Pollpeter, 2007). It is unclear how much a receiver for the secondgeneration
system, which is not yet operational, will cost. In any case,
since there is no charge to use the public GPS signal, Beidou seems
unlikely to displace GPS in commercial applications, except perhaps
in China. It is possible, however, that commercial navigation systems
could eventually employ Beidou as a supplement to GPS signals.<br><br>












Other Satellites
Shijian<br><br>
The Shijian (※Prototype§) series is a long-running space-science and
technology demonstrator program. The first satellite in the series,
Shijian 1, launched in 1971, was the second satellite launched by China
(the first, launched in 1970, was called Dongfanghong and carried only
a radio transmitter). Currently, nine satellites in the series are operating:<br><br>
Shijian 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E, 6F, 7, 11-01, and 12. The Shijian 6 series
was launched into LEO in three pairs between September 2004 and
October 2008. According to the Chinese government, the Shijian 6
mission is ※exploration of space environment, radiation in space and
their influence, parameters of physical environment of the space, and
other related space experiments§ (※Shijian Series,§ 2010). However,
few details about the satellites have been revealed by Chinese media, and the launch dates have been announced only 24 hours in advance.<br><br>
Some sources reportedly suspect that they are signals-intelligence or
electronic-intelligence satellites (※UCS Satellite Database§; ※Shijian
Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
Shijian 7, launched in July 2005, is in an orbit that is similar,
albeit somewhat lower, than that of the Shijian 6 series (555 km ℅
570 km vs. 590 km ℅ 605 km). Shijian 11-01, launched in November
2009, is in a distinctly higher orbit (690 km ℅ 705 km). As is the case
with the Shijian 6 series, little information about Shijian 7 and Shijian
11-01 has been released, other than to say that they will monitor
the space environment and/or conduct space-science and engineering
experiments (※UCS Satellite Database§; ※Shijian Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
Shijian 12 was launched, on similarly short notice, in June 2010.<br><br>
Over the following two months, it was maneuvered into an orbit nearly
identical to that of Shijian 6F, and on August 19 it approached Shijian
6F so closely that it may have actually made contact with it, the
first known instance in which a non-U.S. satellite has conducted such
a rendezvous (the United States has conducted similar operations in
the past). Such a capability has multiple potential applications, such
as clearing space debris, inspecting and repairing satellites, or docking
with a space station such as the Tiangong module that China plans to
put up next year. Another possibility, however, would be to damage
or interfere with an enemy satellite (※Shijian Series,§ 2010; Courtland,
2010).Other recent satellites in the Shijian series are Shijian 5, launched
in May 1999, and Shijian 8, launched in September 2006 (no information
is available on a Shijian 9 or 10, if they exist). Shijian 5 was
apparently a test of a modular minisatellite platform to be used for
various applications, although objectives of the mission reportedly also
included measurement of high-energy particles in near-earth space and
a microgravity fluid-physics experiment. The satellite is no longer operational.
Shijian 8 was officially a recoverable microgravity seed-growing
mission (using the same recoverable capsule used by China＊s FSW film
reconnaissance satellites) designed to study the effects of radiation and
microgravity on different varieties of fruit and vegetable seeds, fungi,
and molecular biomaterials. No information is available on whether the mission had additional purposes. The recoverable capsule returned
to earth after 15 days, and the satellite reentered the atmosphere in
November 2006 (※Shijian Series,§ 2010)<br><br>
Beijing 1 (DMC-4, Tsinghua-2)<br><br>
Beijing 1 is an earth-mapping small satellite, built in cooperation with
Surrey Satellite Company of England and launched in October 2005.<br><br>
It carries the China Mapping Telescope, with a resolution of about 4 m
(※Europe＊s Student-Built Satellite Rockets into Space,§ 2005). Another
imaging camera on board has resolution of 32 m. The satellite weighs
150 kg. As of July 2010, it was apparently still in operation (※China
DMC+4 Satellite Launched, Carries 4 m Resolution Camera,§ 2005;
※UCS Satellite Database§).<br><br>
Chuangxin<br><br>
Chuangxin 1, launched in October 2003, is a mini ※store and forward§
communications satellite. It was developed by CAS, the Shanghai Academy
of Space Technology (SAST, a subsidiary of CASC), and Shanghai
Telecom. The project has been carried out jointly by researchers from
the CAS Shanghai Institute of Microsystem Information Technology
and the CAS Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics (※Small Satellite
Launch Successful,§ 2003). Chuangxin 1 was launched piggyback
with CBERS-2 in 2003 and weighs less than 100 kg (※CBERS 2 and
Chuangxin 1 to Be Launched on 21st or 22nd,§ 2003). CAS claims
that it will serve a range of functions by providing data communications
for such sectors as traffic and transportation, environmental protection,
oil and gas transportation, flood and drought control, detection
of forest fires, and earthquake monitoring. As of July 2010, it was
apparently still in operation (※UCS Satellite Database§; ※Small Satellite
Launch Successful,§ 2003).<br><br>
A second satellite in the series, Chuangxin 2, was launched in
November 2008 and was apparently still in operation as of July 2010
(※UCS Satellite Database§). Information on its nominal purpose was
not available. <br><br>

Shiyan<br><br>
The Shiyan (※Test§) satellite (also called Tansuo or Experimental Satellite)
is the first Chinese satellite capable of stereo earth-terrain mapping.
Its applications are allegedly civilian in nature, but the test of its
systems is said to be useful for military reconnaissance spacecraft under
development. Shiyan 1, launched in April 2004, is relatively light at
204 kg. No word was given about its development before launch. It is
said to have a 10-m stereo resolution observation capacity, developed
with input from Astrium. It was developed by CAS, the Research Institute
of Space Technology, Xi＊an Surveys and Designs Institute, Harbin
Polytechnic University, and Changchun Photomechanical Institute. A
second satellite in the series, Shiyan 2, launched in November 2004,
is larger at 300 kg, and descriptions of its mission are vague. A third
satellite, Shiyan 3, was launched in November 2008. Information on
its nominal purpose is not available. As of July 2010, all three satellites
were apparently still in operation (※China Launches Two New
Satellites,§ 2004; ※Experimental Satellite #1 and Naxing #1 Sent into
Space,§ 2004; Hitchens, 2006, pp. 12每13; ※UCS Satellite Database§).<br><br>
Naxing<br><br>
Naxing 1 is an experimental 25-kg ※nanosatellite§ launched piggyback
with Shiyan 1 in April 2004 and said to be used to conduct ※some
high-tech experiments.§ Little is known about its full functions. It is
the world＊s smallest satellite with three-axis stabilization. As of July
2010, it was apparently still in operation (※Naxing 1§; Johnson-Freese,
2005, p. 8; ※UCS Satellite Database§).<br><br>
Zheda Pixing<br><br>
Zheda Pixing 1, a ※picosatellite§ developed by Zhejiang University
and Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology,
CAS, was launched in May 2007. It has no moving parts and no attitude
control and weighs only 2.5 kg. It is designed for microelectronic
mechanical systems (MEMS) experiments for systems such as accelerometers,
microgyros, and infrared sensors. Little else is publicized
about its mission or specifications. As of July 2010, it was apparently
still in operation (※UCS Satellite Database§).<br><br>

On September 22, 2010, two additional satellites in the series,
Zheda Pixing 1B and Zheda Pixing 1C, were launched. They, too, are
said to have been developed by Zhejiang University ※for microelectronics
studies to provide a testbed in near-earth space for MEMS devices,
such as an accelerometer, micro-gyros and infrared sensors§ (※Zheda
Pixing 1B§).<br><br>
Xiwang 1<br><br>
Xiwang 1 (※Hope 1§) is a 50-kg Chinese amateur-radio satellite
launched as a secondary payload with Yaogan 8 in December 2009
(※Yaogan Series,§ 2010).<br><br>
Double Star<br><br>
The Double Star (Tan Ce) dual satellites are part of a cooperative venture
with the European Space Agency (ESA) to conduct space-science
experiments. Their mission is to study the earth＊s magnetic field and
particle environment, operating in concert with ESA＊s four Cluster
spacecraft. Double Star 1 burnt up on reentry in 2007, but Double
Star 2 was apparently still in orbit as of July 2010, although its mission
was said to have been terminated (※Double Star [Tan Ce],§ 2010;
※UCS Satellite Database§).<br><br>
Assessment<br><br>
China＊s space capabilities have made remarkable progress over the past
two decades. Its satellite capabilities, in particular, have gone from
rudimentary to near-state-of-the-art in some areas. Prior to 1988, the
only satellites China had orbited other than experimental satellites were
recoverable film reconnaissance satellites and low-capacity telecommunications
satellites. Since that time, however, China has successively
developed and deployed a series of weather satellites, medium-capacity
communications satellites, electro-optical reconnaissance satellites,
PNT satellites, ocean-surveillance satellites, SAR satellites, highcapacity
communications satellites, and possibly signals-intelligence or electronic-intelligence satellites. The capacity and reliability of China＊s
space launch vehicles have increased as well.<br><br>
The space capabilities China now possesses have the potential
to significantly increase the effectiveness of its military operations.<br><br>
China＊s seven optical reconnaissance satellites (eight, if CBERS 2B is
counted) are in orbits that cause them to revisit locations every three
to six days, meaning that one or two of them are likely to pass over a
given location each day. These satellites have sufficient resolution to
detect and identify types of ships, aircraft, and ground vehicles. One
of China＊s three SAR reconnaissance satellites, which are equally effective
at night, is also likely to pass over a given location once or twice a
day. These satellites likely have lower resolution than China＊s opticalreconnaissance
satellites, but they are not significantly affected by the
presence of clouds and likely have sufficient resolution to at least determine
the presence of aircraft at an airfield and distinguish broad types
of ships (e.g., aircraft carriers from cargo ships). Finally, if the Shijian
6 series and Yaogan 9 satellites are indeed electronic-intelligence satellites,
then they can detect and identify radio-frequency emitters such as
radio communications equipment and radar based on their frequency
and waveforms.<br><br>
These reconnaissance satellites could have several effects. Their
ability to identify the locations, numbers, and types of enemy forces
will reduce the ability of adversaries to achieve operational surprise
against China, since China will be able to detect the massing of forces;
it will also enable the Chinese military to more effectively conduct
its own attacks. For example, China could use its satellites to determine
the presence of aircraft on the ground at an airbase and launch a
combined air and missile attack against them. The satellites could also
enable China to determine the presence and locations of land-based air
and missile defense systems (e.g., Patriot) and avoid or neutralize them
before launching air and missile attacks on other targets. Similarly,
China could use them to locate and attack mobile radio transmitters
and command posts, reducing an adversary＊s ability to command and
communicate with its forces. Finally, in combination with other systems,
such as over-the-horizon radar, reconnaissance satellites could be
used to find and locate ships at sea, such as aircraft carriers, and then attack them with a variety of weapons, including the anti-ship ballistic
missile China is developing. Once an attack has been conducted, moreover,
China＊s satellites could be used to assess the effectiveness of the
attack and whether additional attacks were needed.
PNT satellites provide a number of important military capabilities.<br><br>
They can be used as the guidance systems for missiles, gravity
bombs, and other types of weapons, enabling all-weather near-precision
attacks. They can also be used to guide ships, aircraft, and ground
vehicles, enabling precise navigation and maneuvers. Moreover, if Chinese
vehicles are equipped with PNT satellite receivers and radio transmitters
that rebroadcast their coordinates, that information could be
used as the basis for an identification system. Knowing the locations
of friendly units would allow the identity of tracks acquired by sensors
such as radars to be more readily determined, enabling enemy units to
be attacked more effectively and reducing the likelihood of attacks on
friendly units. Finally, the precise timing signals broadcast by satellites
in China＊s second-generation Compass system can be used to synchronize
automated data links, enabling high-volume exchanges of data.<br><br>
Although publicly available signals from the U.S. GPS system can
also be used to support these functions, China＊s Compass system will
likely be able to provide higher-precision position and timing than the
public GPS signals. Having its own PNT satellite system, moreover,
ensures China against a cutoff of the U.S. public GPS signal, however
unlikely that may be (as civilian commerce becomes increasingly reliant
on GPS, the economic disruption caused by a shutoff would be
significant). Finally, since the Compass system uses different frequencies
than the GPS system, China＊s military could jam GPS frequencies,
thus denying the United States or other countries access to the GPS
signal without obstructing its own ability to acquire PNT information.<br><br>
China＊s communications-satellite capabilities are considerably
weaker than its reconnaissance and PNT capabilities. Currently, China
has only two dedicated military communications satellites. By comparison,
the U.S. military operates approximately 30 such satellites. Stateowned
corporations based in mainland China control another six or
seven communications satellites, which could potentially be commandeered
for military purposes in the event of a crisis or conflict, but this would still provide China＊s military with far less satellite communications
capability than the U.S. military possesses. China has the advantage,
however, that for the foreseeable future, the conflicts in which it
is likely to become involved would not entail the deployment of significant
forces outside of mainland China. Forces operating in China can
rely primarily on buried fiber-optic cables, which have far higher communications
capacity, for communications connectivity. Buried fiberoptic
cables are virtually impossible to jam and are difficult or impossible
to find from the air or space, and their above-ground equipment,
such as gateways, is easy to hide. Communications satellites occupy
known, fixed locations and thus can be jammed, and their tracking
and control stations are fixed and easily identified and thus potentially
subject to attack. Because fiber-optic cable can carry many times more
data than a satellite can, the commercial world has seen a de-emphasis
of satellites relative to terrestrial cables (including undersea cables) in
recent years. Satellite communications would be important primarily
to naval forces at sea and ground forces deployed outside of China＊s
borders (e.g., on Taiwan). Given the still-incomplete process of linking
China＊s forces together using digital information links, moreover,
China＊s limited communications-satellite capacity may be sufficient for
the immediate future, and this capacity will likely grow over time.<br><br>
As noted earlier in this chapter, knowing and predicting weather
can be crucial to successful military operations, but having one＊s own
weather satellites is not necessarily critical to this capability. China
could rely on data from other countries＊ civilian weather satellites.<br><br>
Having its own weather satellites, however, provides China with a
hedge against a cutoff of such data in the event of a confrontation with
the United Sates or other countries.<br><br>
In sum, China＊s military satellite capabilities today are substantial
and growing. China possesses at least 10 imagery reconnaissance satellites
and possibly six or more electronic-intelligence satellites. Information
in unclassified sources indicates that these numbers are similar to
the numbers of comparable satellites the United States possesses. However,
the capabilities of China＊s satellites undoubtedly fall well short of
those of the United States. For example, China＊s best optical satellites
are estimated to have resolution of about 0.8 m. By comparison, commercial satellite imagery with resolution of 0.41 m is now available,
and U.S. intelligence satellites are believed to have even better resolution
(Matthews, 2008). Nevertheless, the capabilities of China＊s satellites
are probably sufficient for most military purposes. As noted above,
0.8-m resolution is more than sufficient to detect and identify by type
ships, aircraft, and ground vehicles. Greater degrees of resolution are
primarily of utility for intelligence-collection purposes, such as measuring
the exact dimensions of a missile. Most militaries are more open
and transparent than the Chinese military is (or the Soviet military
was), however, and much of this type of information is available from
open sources. Thus, the qualitative inferiority of China＊s surveillance
and reconnaissance satellites may not significantly impact their military
utility, and China may have alternative means to compensate for
their shortcomings as strategic intelligence-collection platforms.<br><br>
China＊s capabilities in communications, PNT, and weather satellites
are less robust than those in surveillance and reconnaissance.<br><br>
Moreover, China has experienced setbacks and delays in many of its
satellite programs, most prominently the total loss of two out of four
high-capacity communications satellites launched so far and the partial
loss of a third. China＊s weather-satellite program appears to be delayed,
and several non-military programs have experienced delays as well.6 As
argued above, however, probably none of these shortcomings are crucial.<br><br>
China probably needs significantly less satellite-communications
capacity than the United States does, can use public GPS signals for
PNT purposes, and can augment information collected by its own
weather satellites with information collected by the satellites of other
countries and made publicly available. Moreover, programs are under
way to address many of these shortcomings in the next few years.<br><br>
China＊s commercial space prospects appear to be less promising
in the near term. The only buyers of China＊s communications satellites
have been Nigeria and Venezuela, countries that may have chosen to buy from China for political or cost reasons rather than because of
the capabilities of the satellites offered. And as a result of the failure of
two of four examples of the DFH-4 platform on which these satellites
were based, increased insurance premiums on future purchases of this
type may erase much of the cost advantage. Nonetheless, Nigeria has
reportedly ordered three more satellites based on the DFH-4 platform
(※NigComSat,§ 2010). If these satellites are successfully launched and
operated in the next few years, China＊s ability to sell such satellites to
other countries may improve.<br><br>
In the area of commercial imagery, China is not known to have
offered for sale the high-resolution imagery provided by CBERS 2B or
its Ziyuan or Yaogan series of imagery satellites. This may in part be
to avoid revealing the capabilities of those satellites, but the Chinese
government also does not accept the legitimacy of the satellites of other
countries collecting intelligence information on China from space,
and it claims that its own satellites do not image the territory of other
countries (conversation with Chinese space official, April 2008). Thus,
China might have difficulty offering satellite imagery for sale without
contradicting its own government＊s position. In any case, given that
higher-resolution commercial imagery is already available from other
sources, China＊s satellites might have difficulty competing in the commercial
imagery market.<br><br>
Finally, once the Compass constellation of PNT satellites is complete,
around 2020, it is possible that China could offer access to its
high-precision signal on a subscription basis. Given that the public GPS
signal is freely available, however, it is not clear how many individuals
or organizations would be willing to pay for a higher-precision signal.<br><br>
Thus, China＊s strongest and most marketable space capability
probably remains its space launch capability. As noted earlier in this
chapter, China＊s space-lift vehicles, although not as powerful as those
of the United States, the ESA, or Russia, have compiled a remarkable
record of success since 1996. However, because of restrictions the United
States imposed in the late 1990s on China＊s launching of satellites with
U.S. technology content, since 1998 only three of those launches have
been for foreign customers, and two of those were of NigComSat and
Venesat, Chinese-made satellites. Palapa D1, launched in August 2009 for an Indonesian company, however, was built by Thales Alenia Space
without using American components and thus was not subject to U.S.
export restrictions (※Palapa Series,§ 2010). It might represent the leading
edge of a new wave of launches of commercial satellites without
U.S. technology content, except that, ironically, the launch of Palapa
D1 is the one known failure of a Chinese launch vehicle in the past 14
years. Whether Chinese launch vehicles will become popular again for
contract launches remains to be seen. <br><br>
