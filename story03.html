Preface<br><br>
China’s aerospace industry has advanced at an impressive rate over the
past decade. While some of this progress can be attributed to rapidly
growing governmental support for China’s aerospace sector, China’s
aerospace capabilities have also benefited from the increasing participation
of its aerospace industry in the global commercial aerospace
market and the supply chains of the world’s leading aerospace firms.<br><br>
This monograph assesses China’s aerospace capabilities and the extent
to which China’s participation in commercial aerospace markets and
supply chains is contributing to the improvement of those capabilities.<br><br>
Specific areas assessed include China’s commercial aviation manufacturing
capabilities, its commercial and military capabilities in space,
efforts of the Chinese government to encourage foreign participation
in the development of the aerospace industry, transfers of foreign aerospace
technology to China, the extent to which U.S. and other foreign
aerospace firms are dependent on supplies from China, and the
implications of all of these issues for U.S. security interests. The study
should be of interest to business analysts, policymakers, lawmakers,
and anyone who wishes to learn about China’s market for commercial
aviation, the capabilities of China’s aerospace manufacturing industry,
the role foreign aerospace firms are playing in the development of
China’s aerospace capabilities, and security implications for the United
States.This research was sponsored by the U.S-China Economic and
Security Review Commission, which was established by Congress in
2000 to monitor and report on the economic and national security dimensions of U.S. trade and economic ties with the People’s Republic
of China.<br><br>

China’s aerospace industry has advanced at an impressive rate over the
past decade. While some of this progress can be attributed to rapidly
growing governmental support for China’s aerospace sector, China’s
aerospace capabilities have also benefited from the increasing participation
of its aerospace industry in the global commercial aerospace
market and the supply chains of the world’s leading aerospace firms.<br><br>
This monograph assesses China’s aerospace capabilities and the extent
to which China’s participation in commercial aerospace markets and
supply chains is contributing to the improvement of those capabilities.<br><br>
Specific areas assessed include China’s commercial aviation manufacturing
capabilities, its commercial and military capabilities in space,
efforts of the Chinese government to encourage foreign participation
in the development of China’s aerospace industry, transfers of foreign
aerospace technology to China, the extent to which U.S. and other
foreign aerospace firms are dependent on supplies from China, and the
implications of all of these issues for U.S. security interests.<br><br>
Chinese airlines, which today operate about 1,400 large commercial
aircraft and regional jets, are projected to purchase roughly 4,000
new jetliners over the next 20 years. Actual purchases could be more
or less than this projection, depending on whether China’s economy
grows at the expected rate and on the availability of alternative forms
of transportation such as high-speed rail. Chinese air freight companies
will likely purchase another 100 to 200 cargo aircraft, but many
of them may be converted aging passenger planes. In September 2009,
there were about 200 civil helicopters in China, and approximately 1,200 additional civil helicopters are expected to be purchased by 2018.<br><br>
China’s general aviation market may be set for an explosion of growth.
As of late 2009, the nation’s severely restrictive airspace management
regime had limited the number of fixed-wing general aviation aircraft
in China to about 800 (compared with 230,000 in the United States).
Reforms are under way, however, and the number of fixed-wing general
aviation aircraft in China is expected to increase by 30 percent per
year over the next five to 10 years, resulting in more than 10,000 new
aircraft by 2020.<br><br>
Except possibly in the case of helicopters, China’s current ability
to meet demand with indigenous aircraft is limited. Its indigenous
regional jet, the ARJ21, will begin deliveries in 2011, but the regional
jet market in China is small. China’s indigenous large commercial aircraft,
the C919, will not begin deliveries until the middle of the decade,
at the earliest, and it will be a narrow-body aircraft that competes only
with the Boeing 737 series and Airbus A320 series. All wide-body aircraft
will be imported at least through 2020. Although Chinese airlines
will apparently be required to buy at least some C919s, their preference,
and that of their customers, will continue to be for Boeing and
Airbus aircraft with proven safety and reliability records. If the C919
can establish a comparable safety and reliability record, however, and
can offer improved comfort and fuel efficiency, it is possible that, over
time, it will begin to take market share away from Boeing and Airbus
(provided, of course, that Boeing and Airbus do not bring to market
even better aircraft in the meantime).<br><br>
Chinese manufacturers already produce light utility helicopters
and medium transport helicopters, and a medium utility helicopter
and possibly a heavy transport helicopter are in development. Given
China’s limited civil helicopter market, its domestic manufacturing
capabilities may be sufficient to satisfy demand, although specialized
types of helicopters may be imported. If the fixed-wing general aviation
market in China grows as rapidly as projected, much of the demand
will be filled by imported aircraft, as the variety of domestic offerings
is extremely limited.<br><br>

The Chinese government has attempted to leverage airliner purchases
in exchange for arrangements that it hopes will lead to technology transfers into China’s aviation manufacturing industry. In the
ARJ21 regional jet and C919 airliner projects in particular, a condition
for foreign aerospace firms to be selected as suppliers has often
been that a local production facility be established. Partly as a result
of these policies, U.S. and other foreign aerospace manufacturers are
engaged in numerous joint ventures and other technology transfers
with China’s aviation industry. In many cases, however, foreign aerospace
manufacturers have established joint ventures in China not to sell
products there but to acquire access to China’s low-cost, high-quality
labor for manufacturing products that are sold throughout the world.<br><br>
As of today, only about 1 percent of U.S. aerospace imports come from
China.China’s space capabilities have improved rapidly in the past decade
and a half. China’s Long March series have arguably become the world’s
most reliable medium space launch vehicles. China has also developed
and deployed a series of weather satellites; electro-optical reconnaissance
satellites; position, navigation, and timing (PNT) satellites; oceansurveillance
satellites; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites; highcapacity
communications satellites; and possibly signals-intelligence or
electronic-intelligence satellites. China has also become the third country
to put humans in space. Over the next decade, China’s surveillance
and reconnaissance, communications, and weather satellite capabilities
will undoubtedly improve further, and by 2020, China will likely have
a fully deployed satellite PNT system comparable to the U.S. Global
Positioning System (GPS).<br><br>
There is no question that China’s growing civilian aerospace
capabilities are contributing to the development of its military aerospace
capabilities. Many aerospace systems are inherently dual-use or
can provide a basis for the development of military systems. Moreover,
many of the skills and technologies required to produce commercial
or dual-use aerospace products are also applicable to purely military
systems. And given that China and the United States have conflicting
interests in East Asia and elsewhere, China’s growing aerospace
capabilities increase its ability and possibly its propensity to use force
in ways that negatively affect U.S. interests and would increase the
costs―human and material―of resisting such force.	<br><br>

Foreign involvement in China’s civil aerospace sector has unquestionably
contributed to its development and thus to the development
of China’s military capabilities. However, it is difficult to quantify the
extent to which international cooperation in the civilian aerospace
sector is driving improvements in those capabilities. This makes the
implications for U.S. security policy unclear. A complete cutoff of
international cooperation in the civilian aerospace sector is impractical,
as many countries would refuse to go along with such an embargo.<br><br>
A U.S.-only ban would likely slow the development of China’s military
aerospace capability by only a small amount while handing business
opportunities to European and Asian companies and aggravating
relations with Beijing. Moreover, conflict or confrontation with China
is not inevitable. Thus, whether the United States could significantly
improve its security through alterations of its policy toward civil aerospace
cooperation with China without having a significant negative
effect on its own economic interests is unclear.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
China’s aerospace industry has advanced at an impressive rate over the
past decade. While some of this progress can be attributed to rapidly
growing governmental support for China’s aerospace sector, China’s
aerospace capabilities have also benefited from the increasing participation
of its aerospace industry in the global commercial aerospace
market and the supply chains of the world’s leading aerospace firms.<br><br>

<a href= "pic37.html">宫崎骏《航迹云》</a><br><br>

This monograph assesses China’s aerospace capabilities and the degree
to which China’s participation in commercial aerospace markets and
supply chains is contributing to the improvement of those capabilities.<br><br>
Most major aviation manufacturers―Boeing, Airbus, General
Electric (GE), Rolls-Royce, and Pratt & Whitney―have joint ventures
in China or source components from China. China has also received
technical assistance from Western companies in the development of
airliners, avionics, satellites, and other systems. Although joint ventures
and assistance from Western companies are generally confined
to purely civilian technologies, this assistance may nonetheless be contributing
to the development of China’s military aerospace capabilities.<br><br>
This monograph assesses the growth of China’s aerospace capabilities
and the extent to which China’s participation in commercial
aerospace markets and supply chains is contributing to that growth.<br><br>
Specific areas assessed include China’s commercial aviation manufacturing
capabilities, its commercial and military capabilities in space,
efforts of the Chinese government to encourage foreign participation
in the development of China’s aerospace industry, transfers of foreign
aerospace technology to China, the extent to which U.S. and other


foreign aerospace firms are dependent on supplies from China, and the
implications of all of these issues for U.S. security interests.<br><br>
Methodology<br><br>
The study reported here was fundamentally empirical and inductive.<br><br>
Its primary task was to collect and synthesize publicly available information
on China’s aerospace capabilities and the involvement of foreign
aerospace firms in China. Much of the information used came
from Western and Chinese aerospace industry trade publications and
from the websites of foreign and Chinese companies.<br><br>
In assessing the significance of the capabilities and technologies
that China is acquiring, the authors drew on their knowledge of the
aerospace industry, technology issues, Chinese military capabilities,
and U.S. security concerns in East Asia acquired through their academic
training, previous work experience, and nearly 20 years of combined
experience at RAND.<br><br>
Structure of the Report<br><br>
Chapter Two examines China’s commercial aircraft market. It assesses
the size of the current passenger aircraft market, summarizes projections
of its future growth, and analyzes factors that are likely to affect
that growth, such as the availability of high-speed rail transport. It also
describes the markets for cargo aircraft, helicopters, and fixed-wing
general aviation in China.<br><br>
Chapter Three describes China’s current commercial aircraft production
capabilities, including those for commercial passenger aircraft,
helicopters, and fixed-wing general aviation aircraft. Chapter Four
analyzes the role of foreign firms in the development of China’s aviation
manufacturing industry. It summarizes the policies of the Chinese
government toward foreign companies, describes U.S. and other foreign
joint ventures and cooperative research and development (R&D)


activities in China, and documents the extent to which China-based
production supplies U.S. aerospace firms.<br><br>
Chapter Five describes China’s commercial and military space
capabilities. These include launch vehicles, communications satellites,
weather satellites, civilian earth-observation satellites, military imagery
reconnaissance satellites, and position, navigation, and timing (PNT)
satellites. It also assesses the national security implications of China’s
military space capabilities.<br><br>
Finally, Chapter Six assesses the rate at which China’s aerospace
sector has developed, considers aerospace capabilities that China will
likely develop in the future, analyzes the potential for China’s civilian
aerospace capabilities to contribute to the development of military
aerospace capabilities, and assesses the implications for U.S. security
interests.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">Chapter Two China’s Commercial Aircraft Market</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
China is already the world’s second-largest national air travel market,
trailing only the United States. This market, moreover, is likely to grow
rapidly over the next two decades―an estimated 4,000 new passenger
aircraft are expected to be purchased by Chinese airlines over this
period. This represents approximately one-eighth of the total world
demand during the next 20 years. The markets for cargo aircraft, general
aviation, and helicopters in China, although significantly smaller
than that for passenger aircraft, are also expected to grow rapidly in
the coming years.<br><br>
Current Conditions<br><br>
In 2007, China’s major airlines1 booked more than 230 billion revenue
passenger-kilometers (RPK), or almost 31 billion tonne-kilometers,
flown. Passenger-kilometers and tonne-kilometers are standard measures
in the aviation industry, where the number of passengers flown or
the total weight carried (including passengers) is multiplied by the distance
traveled. For comparison, China’s RPK is about 20 percent that of
U.S. airlines, more than the traffic carried by either German or Japanese

airlines and about 6.7 percent of all world traffic in 2007 (International
Air Transport Association, 2008). See Figure 2.1.<br><br>

<a href= "pic21.html">Figure 2.1 RPK Flown by Major Airlines of Brazil, China, Japan, Germany, and the United States in 2007</a><br><br>

To support that level of air transport, Chinese airlines used a fleet
of roughly 1,350 large commercial aircraft and 60 regional jets in 2010
(World Aerospace Database). The large commercial aircraft fleet comprises
55 percent Boeing airplanes and 43 percent Airbus airplanes.<br><br>
Most of the remaining 2 percent are McDonnell Douglas aircraft produced
before McDonnell Douglas’s merger with Boeing. The Chinese
commercial fleet is approximately 20 percent the size of the North
AmericanCbased large commercial aircraft fleet and just over 7 percent
of the world fleet.<br><br>
China’s commercial aviation market is dominated by the “big
three”―Air China, China Eastern, and China Southern. These airlines
were created by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in
2000 and 2001 to rationalize the air transport market (Chung, 2003).<br><br>
They are all effectively controlled by the central government. Hainan
Airlines is the largest private startup airline. Figure 2.2 shows the RPK
distribution of all Chinese airlines.<br><br>
 

<a href= "pic22.html">Figure 2.2 RPK Distribution of Chinese Airlines</a><br><br>
Figures 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 compare international, domestic, and
total RPK of major airlines in the United States, Japan, and Germany
with that of the three largest Chinese airlines. In 2007, China’s “big
three” were in the top 10 airlines worldwide in domestic RPK, but not in the top 20 for international RPK. In total RPK, they held the
13th, 18th, and 21st positions (International Air Transport Association,
2008). This suggests that they are major world airlines, but their size is heavily dependent on the domestic market, which is protected
from foreign competition, as most domestic air markets are. In the
international market, their relatively smaller share of traffic suggests
that they are not yet competitive with other international air carriers.<br><br>

The dedicated air freight market, like the passenger market, has
above-average growth rates in Asia. However, air cargo accounted for
less than 6 percent of departures worldwide and less than 8 percent of
kilometers flown in 2007, according to the International Air Transport
Association (2008). Boeing projects a demand for 2,490 freighters
worldwide over the next 20 years (Boeing, 2010, p. 10), but more than
two-thirds of those will be converted from aging passenger planes.<br><br>
Similarly, Airbus estimates a demand for 3,439 freighters but expects
that 75 percent of the demand will be met with converted passenger
planes, leaving only 800 to 1,000 purpose-built freight aircraft. Airbus
projects the Asia-Pacific freighter fleet to account for 37 percent of the
global freighter fleet by 2028 (Airbus, 2009, p. 153). If 37 percent of
1,000 air freighters built over the next 20 years are sold in Asia, this
will not significantly affect the total number of large commercial aircraft
expected to be sold in China during that period. The total will
probably be around 4,000 (see below), even if all 370 newly built freight
aircraft are purchased by China.<br><br>
The development of the rail and highway systems within China is
likely to have minimal impact on future air freight trends. Air freight
is the most expensive method for moving cargo, and it is generally only
used when transit time is an issue or the cargo has a high-monetaryvalue
density, e.g., fresh flowers or computer chips. Improvements in
China’s rail and highway system are unlikely to result in a significant
proportion of the relatively small amount of domestic freight that currently
travels by air being shifted to ground transportation. In any case,
most of China’s air freight traffic is international, and improvements
in China’s domestic road and rail system are unlikely to reduce travel
times by a significant enough amount for cargos that can be delivered
by air in a day or two to instead be sent by ship, rail, or truck.
China’s general aviation sector is still in a relatively early stage
of development. According to CAAC sources, as of the end of 2009,
there were only 997 registered fixed- and rotary-wing general aviation aircraft, including law-enforcement helicopters, in the country. In contrast,
at least 230,000 general aviation aircraft were registered in the
United States (Cheng, 2010). At present, China simply has not developed
an adequate physical or regulatory infrastructure for general aviation.<br><br>
As of the end of 2008, it had only 71 airports for general aviation,
apart from the 160 airports used for scheduled flights (compared with
more than 18,000 general aviation airports in the United States), and
the country also had a serious shortage of general aviation pilots (Li
and Wang, 2009, p. 52). In particular, China’s severely restrictive airspace
management regime is widely considered to be a bottleneck to
the development of the general aviation market. Low-altitude airspace
is restricted in most of China, and most general aviation flights must
secure prior clearance, a process that typically takes at least several days
(Xin, 2006). However, as of October 2010, reforms were under way to
lift the restriction on low-altitude airspace (below 1,000 meters), starting
with Guangdong and the three Manchurian provinces on a trial
basis (Wang and Xin, 2010)<br><br>
Although airspace management reforms have been slower and
more limited than many Chinese analysts had wished (Wang and Xin,
2010), the analysts are hopeful that the reforms will help propel the
“takeoff” of Chinese general aviation. According to CAAC projections,
by the end of the 12th Five Year Plan (2015), China is expected to
require between 10,000 and 12,000 general aviation aircraft of various
types. During the next five to 10 years, the number is expected
to increase by an average of 30 percent annually, and the value of the
general aviation market is expected to reach more than 1 trillion Renminbi
(RMB) (Meng, 2010). It should be noted, however, that such
projections are often based on perceived potential market demand
alone. They do not account for serious supply-side bottlenecks such as
the shortage of general aviation airports and qualified pilots.<br><br>
A particularly attractive segment of the general aviation market
may be business aviation. According to industry data, as of the end of
2009, there were 50,000 business aircraft in the world, 18,000 of them
in the United States alone. Even a developing country such as Brazil boasted 2,000 business aircraft, whereas China had only 30 in commercial
operation at that time. At present, China has an import tariff
of 4 percent and a value-added tax of 17 percent on business aircraft,
but these have done little to dampen the rapid expansion in business
aviation in recent years: Deer Jet (a subsidiary of Hainan Airlines),
by far the largest charter aircraft company in China, with 84 percent
of the charter market, has seen its operational volume increase by 21
percent in 2008 and 32 percent in 2009, with a projected 60-percent
increase in 2010 (Shi, 2010, p. 69). According to 2009 projections by
Bombardier, between 2009 and 2018 the Chinese market will require
at least 300 business aircraft, while more-optimistic projections put the
figure at as high as 1,000 or more (Shi, 2010, pp. 67C68). Since China
does not appear to have an indigenous business-aircraft development
program, all of these aircraft will presumably have to be imported.<br><br>
As of September 2009, China had a total of 208 civil helicopters
(including those in police and emergency service), more than half of
which were light helicopters weighing 4 tons or less (Zhao and Ma,
2009, p. 64). There were only 12 civilian maritime search and rescue
helicopters in the country and, as of July 2008, fewer than 30 police
helicopters spread across 13 police departments (“China’s Police Helicopter
Starts,” 2008, p. 45). As of 2009, there were roughly 0.16 civil
helicopters per million residents, compared with 59.41 for Australia,
41.33 for the United States, 4.28 for Brazil, and a global average of 4.8
(Zhao and Ma, 2009, p. 64; Zhang, 2008, p. 37).2 Most of China’s
civil helicopters are imported―in 2007, only five of the 138 helicopters
registered to civil general aviation companies were domestically produced
(Zhang, 2008, p. 37).<br><br>
Assuming an average annual gross domestic product (GDP)
growth rate of 8 percent, Chinese aviation officials project that the
Chinese civil market will have a total requirement of 1,440 helicopters
by 2018, requiring approximately 1,250 new deliveries. If these
projections are correct, the Chinese market will account for nearly 10
percent of the 12,700 civil helicopters projected for delivery worldwide
between 2010 and 2017 (Xia, 2009, p. 58). <br><br>

Projections of China’s Future Commercial Passenger<br><br>
Aircraft Market<br><br>
Air transit growth is generally characterized by continuous steady
growth punctuated by an occasional major setback, such as occurred in
2002 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks or in 2009 following the world
financial meltdown. Historically, a country’s air transport volume has
grown faster than its GDP. This results from increases in GDP per
capita, which correlate with growth in disposable income and the time
cost of business travelers relative to air travel costs.<br><br>
Boeing’s Current Market Outlook 2010C2029 predicts world GDP
growth at 3.2 percent and RPK growth at 5.3 percent over the next
20 years. This implies 3.3 percent growth in the world airliner fleet
over the same time period (the number of airliners does not increase as
fast as RPK because the average size of airplane used is also projected
to increase). According to Boeing’s calculations, that translates into a
demand for 30,900 new airplanes over the next 20 years, with more
than one-third of those in the Asia-Pacific region, nearly doubling the
size of the world’s airplane fleet, from 18,890 in 2010 to 36,300 in
2029 (Boeing, 2010). See Figure 2.6.<br><br>

<a href= "pic26.html">Figure 2.6 Boeing’s Market Outlook for 2010C2029</a><br><br>

Boeing defines the Asia-Pacific region as China, India, Japan,
Australia, and all of Southeast Asia. The anticipated demand of 10,320
airplanes includes regional jets, but they will account for only 5 percent
of the total, according to Boeing.3 Boeing predicts that Asia-Pacific passenger
traffic will grow from approximately 0.8 trillion RPK to 3.4 trillion
RPK, with more than one-third of that growth coming from Chinese
domestic traffic.4 Boeing appears to anticipate that Chinese airlines
will purchase 38 percent of the 10,320 aircraft, or about 3,900 new
aircraft, over the next 20 years for their domestic market. Boeing thus
expects Chinese airline demand for airplanes to be at least 12 percent of world demand and perhaps more, given their share of international
traffic (Boeing, 2010).<br><br>

Because Boeing hopes to sell airplanes and thus is likely to be
optimistic in its projections, it is prudent to calculate an independent
estimate of the size of China’s future aircraft market. Figure 2.7 shows
RPK flown in Brazil, China, Japan, Germany, and the United States as
a proportion of GDP in U.S. dollars, gross national income (GNI) in
purchasing power parity (PPP), and population.<br><br>

<a href= "pic27.html">Figure 2.7 Normalized RPK Flown by Major Carriers in Each Country in 2007</a><br><br>

As shown, China’s RPK per unit of GDP at official exchange rates
is greater than those of Brazil, Japan, and Germany and over 80 percent
of the U.S. ratio. When the PPP value of China’s GNI is used, however,
the Chinese ratio is significantly below those of the United States and
Germany and roughly equivalent to those of Japan and Brazil. Thus,
China’s unusually high RPK/GDP ratio may be in part an artifact of
an undervalued RMB. Nonetheless, the significant difference between
the U.S. and Japanese ratios also suggests a range of possibilities for
the development of Chinese air transportation. The difference between
the U.S. and Japanese air markets and the direction in which China is
likely to trend will be explored below.<br><br>


China’s future GDP growth is a much-debated issue. Many
believe that China cannot indefinitely sustain its double-digit GDP
growth rates or even its 8 percent GDP growth rate targets. We used a
range of GDP growth rates (4, 6, 8, and 10 percent) over the next 20
years to bound our projections. Combining those four growth rates
with three RPK/GDP trends (U.S.-like, current China, and Japan-like)
produces 12 projections for the growth of the Chinese carrier fleet.
They are plotted in Figure 2.8, along with a linear extrapolation of
Boeing’s 2029 projection. We assume that China’s current fleet is relatively
new and that very few current planes require replacement in the
next 20 years.<br><br>
<a href= "pic28.html">Figure 2.8 Projections of the Growth of the Chinese Commercial Fleet Based on Alternative RPK/GDP Ratios and Average GDP Growth Rates Compared with Boeing’s Projection</a><br><br>

Boeing’s projection is equivalent to the current RPK/GDP ratio
with an average 7 percent annual GDP growth for the next 20 years,
or following a U.S.-like RPK/GDP trend with 6 percent GDP growth.<br><br>
Given the effects of compounding, 10 percent growth rates for 20 years
and the current RPK/GDP ratio would result in fleet growth of almost 8,000 airplanes, more than double Boeing’s projection. However, an
average growth rate of only 5 percent of GDP at the current RPK/GDP
ratio or 8 percent GDP growth but trending toward the Japanese RPK/
GDP ratio would cut the 20-year projection to about 2,000 airplanes,
half of Boeing’s projection.<br><br>


Factors Other Than GDP Growth<br><br>
Wang and Jin (2007) assess major routes in China, using CAAC 2005
data. Between 1980 and 2005, the number of airports in China almost
doubled, from 77 to 142. Annual passenger traffic grew from 3.4 million
to 138.2 million passengers, or from 3.96 billion RPK to 204.5<br><br>
billion RPK. In 2002, 62 percent of China’s population was within
100 km of an airport, and 75 percent of China’s GDP was generated
within 100 km of an airport. In general, eastern China was better covered
percentagewise than western China, while central China lagged behind both. The bulk of Chinese domestic routes are between 400
and 2,000 km in length, with concentrations around 600 km and
1,100 km, driven primarily by the concentration of air traffic in the
Beijing-Shanghai-Guangzhou regional triangle. See Figure 2.9.<br><br>
Jin et al. (2004) and Wang and Jin (2007) describe historical
domestic flight patterns in China. The following key insights are found
in both:<br><br>
 The bulk of domestic passenger routes are in the range of 400 to
2,000 km.<br><br>
 50 percent of the total domestic travel is in a triangle connecting
the greater metropolitan regions of Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou. <br><br>


The concentration of relatively shorter routes (400 to 2,000 km)
would normally suggest greater demand for regional jets, which typically
have shorter ranges. However, on a per-seat basis, regional jets
are more expensive to operate than larger airliners. If there is sufficient
passenger traffic to fill the seats, large commercial aircraft are
more cost-effective. That fact, combined with the extreme concentration
of passenger traffic in three metropolitan regions and the limited
numbers of gates and departure/landing slots, drives the calculus back
toward fewer larger airplanes. It might be thought that the Chinese
government’s focus on infrastructure projects and its ability to overrule
red tape means that many new airports will be built, expanding the
number of available landing slots. However, bureaucratic factors continue
to complicate the expansion of airport infrastructure in China
(Perrett, 2010a).<br><br>
Another important issue is competition from rail and automotive
transport. Traditional rail transport (less than 100 mph), in contrast to
high-speed rail, is more cost-effective than air or automotive transport.<br><br>
India’s extensive rail system helps explain why 98 percent of India’s
population has never flown (“Flight to Value,” 2009). As the standard
of living rises, however, the time cost of travel starts to outweigh the
economic-cost advantage. This does not necessarily make rail uncompetitive
with air travel, but it requires investments in high-speed rail,
which in turn requires higher population densities for economic viability.<br><br>
For example, in Japan, high-speed rail competes directly with air
travel, but in the United States, where the population is much less concentrated,
high-speed rail is cost-effective only in certain areas (e.g., the
Boston-New York City-Washington corridor). Given that China’s population
is highly concentrated and its governance structure is inclined
toward funding major infrastructure projects, the development of
high-speed rail that is competitive with domestic air travel, at least on
shorter routes, seems likely (Perret, 2010a).<br><br>
In fact, high-speed-rail plans in China are quite extensive. According
to the Chinese government’s Medium- to Long-Term Railroad Network
Development Plan (2008), China will construct approximately 16,000 km2 of high-speed passenger designated lines (PDL) by 2020,
with a targeted average speed of over 200 km/hr. These will include the
eight PDL trunk lines in the so-called “four vertical, four horizontal
(四纵四横)” national grid, in addition to shorter intercity commuter
lines to be built in a number of major population centers.<br><br>
The 4×4 national grid will consist of four north-south corridors
and four east-west corridors. The north-south corridors will comprise the
Beijing-Shanghai PDL, the Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou-Shenzhen-
Hong Kong PDL, the Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin PDL, and the
Hangzhou-Ningbo-Fuzhou-Shenzhen PDL (the Coastal PDL). The
four east-west corridors will comprise the Xuzhou-Zhengzhou-
Lanzhou PDL, the Shanghai-Nanchang-Changsha-Kunming PDL,
the Qingdao-Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan PDL, and the Shanghai-Nanjing-
Wuhan-Chongqing-Chengdu PDL. These lines will total roughly
13,000 km, with nearly 3,500 km already completed by mid-2010 (see
Figure 2.10).<br><br>
In addition, China plans to build approximately 3,800 km of
high-speed intercity rail lines in about a dozen metropolitan areas, to
add to the 500 km already in existence by mid-2010. These shorter
commuter lines will average about 200 km each, with a design speed of
around 250 km/hr. These lines can presumably offer residents of major
metropolitan centers more options for airport access.<br><br>
During the same period, the basic framework for the rail net in
western China will also be completed, with the addition of 40,000 km
of tracks. It is said that some of these new lines will be built to accommodate
speeds of 200 to 250 km/hr for both passengers and freight.<br><br>
These are also considered high-speed rails, although they are not part
of the primary PDL grid.<br><br>
If all of these projects are completed as planned, by 2020, China
will have more than 18,000 km of high-speed rail lines with speeds
of 200 km/hr or more, accounting for more than 50 percent of the
global total. With the exception of several major cities in the West (e.g.,
Urumqi, Lhasa), all provincial capitals will be reachable from Beijing
by rail in less than 8 hours (“High-Speed Rail”) (see Figure 2.11). <br><br>

High-speed rail is widely expected to pose a serious challenge to
the airline industry, at least for travel between China’s major coastal
urban centers. As one analyst observes, the typical air travel time
between Shanghai and Beijing, under normal weather conditions, is
around 5 hours. This includes travel time to and from the airport, the
time spent going through security checkpoints, boarding time, etc. On
existing conventional trains, the trip would take 15 to 16 hours, but
by express high-speed trains, it would take only 5 to 6 hours, roughly equivalent to the typical air travel time (Zhao, 1999). Likewise, travel
time on the newly completed Wuhan-Guangzhou PDL is just under
3 hours, compared with a flight time of 1.5 hours for the 1,000-km
trip.<br><br>
While high-speed rail travel may offer some advantages in convenience
and comfort, it is unlikely to offer any cost savings for the average
Chinese traveler. A coach-class ticket between Wuhan and Guangzhou
on the new high-speed train, for example, cost RMB490 (about
$72) as of August 2010 (“Ministry of Railways: High-Speed Train
Fares Are Consistent with Market Conditions,” 2010).5 By comparison, economy-class air fares between Wuhan and Guangzhou range
from RMB370 for late-night flights to RMB470 for the early evening
hours.6 The expensive fares of the new trains have undoubtedly discouraged
many travelers―recent media investigations discovered some
trains running with only a single passenger in a car (“Ministry of Railways
Responds: How 120% Occupancy Rates Are Calculated,” 2010).<br><br>
However, much of the cost of rail transit, including trains and tracks,
consists of sunk costs. Fares on lines that fail to attract significant passenger
traffic will probably be reduced to increase traffic and recoup
some of the sunk costs. In contrast, almost 90 percent of air travel costs
are variable, and even the 10 percent fixed cost for airplane ownership
is not fully sunk, because airplanes can always be sold (Belobaba et al.,
2009, p. 115).<br><br>
The ultimate impact of rail and expanding automotive transit systems
on air traffic patterns is more complicated than simple competition
between rail and air. Major hub airports located on a high-speed
rail line might see shorter regional flights decrease as passengers use the
rail line rather than the connecting regional jets to reach their ultimate
destinations. On the other hand, airports not served by the high-speed
rail will likely see additional growth in passenger traffic as local percapita
earnings rise.<br><br>
Domestic Versus International Traffic<br><br>
Another important dimension of the air transport market is domestic
versus international traffic. Nations have complete regulatory power
over domestic air traffic. Historically, domestic routes are flown only by
domestic airlines, generally referred to as the Eighth and Ninth Freedoms
under the Chicago Convention (Belobaba et al., 2009, p. 22).<br><br>
Even the Open Skies Agreement between the United States and the
European Union (EU) applies only to international flights (Kanter and
Clark, 2010). International route regulation is typically based on bilateral
agreements and is structured with roughly equal landing rights,
i.e., landing slots or airport access. As such, a country’s international
traffic is divided roughly evenly between domestic and foreign airlines.<br><br>

As is the case with all nations, growth in Chinese domestic traffic
will be completely absorbed by Chinese airlines, but international
traffic growth will be split with foreign airlines. Figure 2.12 shows the
distribution of international and domestic passenger traffic for Brazil,
China, Japan, Germany, and the United States.<br><br>

<a href= "pic29.html">Figure 2.12 International and Domestic RPK for Five Nations in 2007</a><br><br>

Very different patterns are evident in the figure. Germany’s airlines
serve international travel almost exclusively; presumably, most
domestic travel in Germany is by rail or automobile. Japanese airlines
provide roughly equal international and domestic service, which makes
sense, as their island chain stretches more than twice the length of
Germany. The United States, being a much larger geographic area,
has longer routes and a much lower population density. Although it
has a well-developed highway system, it has minimal rail service and
essentially no high-speed rail. Thus, U.S. airlines fly two-thirds of their
miles on domestic routes and one-third on international routes.<br><br>
China’s airlines deliver three-fourths of their service on domestic
routes. China is a large geographic area similar in size to the United States, but its population density is both higher and much more concentrated,
with more than 90 percent of the population living in the
eastern half of the country. However, alternative transportation methods,
rails and roads, are not as developed as those in Japan, Germany,
or the United States, leaving Chinese citizens more dependent on air
transport.<br><br>
China’s continuing development of rails and roads is likely to
increase their competitiveness with air transport, which will limit the
growth of domestic air transport. On the other hand, given China’s
vast expanses, rail travel is unlikely to replace air travel to the same
extent that it has in Japan, and increasing per-capita income will likely
result in more Chinese citizens traveling both domestically and abroad
(especially if the Renminbi is allowed to strengthen). Thus, the net
effect is that, in PPP terms, China’s RPK/GNI ratio will likely increase
to a level somewhere between those of the United States and Japan;
and over the next two decades, China’s air transportation market may
continue to grow at a rate somewhat faster than the economy in PPP
terms,7 but projections extrapolated from U.S. figures are likely to
be overstated. In short, Boeing’s projection appears reasonable, if we
assume an average Chinese real growth rate of 7 to 8 percent over the
next two decades. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">Chapter Three China’s Current Commercial Aircraft Production</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Essentially all aircraft manufactured in China, as well as major components
such as engines and propellers, are produced by the Aviation
Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and Commercial Aircraft Corporation
of China, Ltd. (COMAC) and their subsidiaries. AVIC was
created in 1993 from portions of the former Ministry of Aerospace
Industry (Medeiros et al., 2005, p. 157). In 1999, AVIC was split into
two corporations, AVIC I and AVIC II, but, in 2008, they were recombined
and COMAC was spun off as an independent corporation (Perrett,
2009, p. 313).<br><br>
This chapter describes the current output of China’s commercial
aircraft industry, as well as aircraft that are in development. It does not
attempt to analyze the organizations, inputs, or processes involved in
China’s production of commercial aircraft.<br><br>
Commercial Passenger Aircraft<br><br>
China currently produces two domestically designed commercial passenger
aircraft: the MA60-series turboprop and the ARJ21 regional
jet, which has not yet entered into service. China also performs final
assembly on Airbus A320-series narrow-body airliners and produces
the Embraer ERJ-145 regional jet under license.<br><br>
Domestic Designs<br><br>
MA60<br><br>
The MA60 is a 60-seat turboprop airliner manufactured by the Xi’an
Aircraft Corporation (XAC), an AVIC subsidiary. It traces its lineage

back to the Soviet Antonov An-24 airliner. The An-24, a 52-seat turboprop
plane, entered into service with the Soviet airline Aeroflot in
1963. China subsequently purchased 40 of these aircraft and reverseengineered
them, with production beginning in 1982 under the designator
Yun-7 (Y-7). The MA60 is simply an updated version of the
Y-7, the previous version of which since 2001 has not met the CAAC’s
airworthiness requirements. The first prototype MA60 flew in March
2000, and the aircraft was certified for production in December
of that year. An upgrade of the Antonov-built aircraft, called the
An-24RV-100, was unveiled in 2001, but the MA60 does not appear
to be based on this upgrade. According to Chinese official statements,
52 MA60 aircraft had been produced by September 2008, and as of
March 2010, more than 150 orders had supposedly been placed, 50
from foreign airlines and more than 100 from domestic airlines. However,
as of the end of 2009, only four examples appeared to be in service
domestically. The first 11 production versions, moreover, had apparently
been withdrawn from service by 2006 due to “reliability problems
and two runway overruns.” Production on an upgraded version
(the MA60-100, sometimes called the MA600) began in 2008. XAC
is said to have a production capacity of 12 to 15 of these aircraft a year
(“XAC MA60”; “Antonov An-24”; “Xian (Antonov) Y-7”; “China Airlines
Directory 2010,” 2010).<br><br>
ARJ21<br><br>
The ARJ21 is a 90-seat regional jet that has been in testing since
November 2008. The manufacturer, COMAC, partnered with Bombardier
and based the design on the McDonnell Douglas MD-90, a
few of which were co-produced in China in the 1990s. All the major
subsystems are sourced to North American companies, including GE,
Rockwell Collins, and Honeywell. The wings, the remaining most
technically challenging aspect of an airplane, were designed by the
Antonov Aeronautical Scientific/Technical Complex of Ukraine.<br><br>
As of October 2010, the ARJ21 reportedly had 257 orders, with
the first deliveries to Chengdu Airlines expected in late 2011. Virtually
all of these orders are from small domestic Chinese airlines―
Chengdu Airlines, Henan Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, Joy Air, and Shanghai Airlines―and COMAC is actually the majority shareholder
in Chengdu Airlines. There are questions, moreover, about how firm
these “orders” are, as apparently some of them are actually letters of
intent, and buyers reportedly face little or no penalty for cancellation.
The Laotian national carrier, Laos Airlines, has ordered two ARJ21s,
and the privately owned Indonesian mining company Merkukh Enterprises
has reportedly signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
to purchase nine. Over the next 20 years, COMAC hopes to build
850 ARJ21s, with production rates starting at 11 per year in 2010
and growing to 30 per year by 2015 (Burchell, 2010; Francis, 2010a;
Shirouzu, 2010; Yeo, 2010; Francis, 2010c).<br><br>
C919<br><br>
The COMAC 919 will be a single-aisle 130- to 170-seat narrow-body
aircraft intended to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.
The project was launched in 2009 with the goal of initial production
in 2014 and sales by 2020 (Butterworth-Hayes, 2010, p. 27). Orders
from China’s “big three” airlines will be fewer than the several hundred
units COMAC had initially hoped for. At the 2010 Airshow China in
Zhuhai, COMAC announced that 100 C919s had been ordered, but
this number was reached only by including nonbinding options. The
“big three” each committed only to purchasing five C919s. Hainan
Airlines ordered another 20, General Electric Commercial Aviation
Services ordered 10, and the leasing subsidiary of China Development
Bank ordered another 10. General Electric is one of the partners in
CFM International, which will produce the engines for the C919, and
China Development Bank is COMAC’s financier. China’s airlines have
apparently argued that they should not take on more exposure to a program
they regard as risky. Ultimate production goals for the C919 are
150 aircraft per year, to meet one-third of China’s domestic demand
and 10 percent of the international market. The program is reportedly
heavily state-supported, and Chinese engineers are said be getting paid
twice the going rate to work on it (Perrett, 2010b, p. 49; Perrett, 2010c,
p. 20). <br><br>

Foreign Designs<br><br>
A320<br><br>
In September 2008, Airbus Final Assembly Line China (FALC), a joint
venture between Airbus and a Chinese consortium of the Tianjin Free
Trade Zone and AVIC to perform final assembly of Airbus A320-series
aircraft, opened in Tianjin. It delivered its first A320 in June 2009 and
as of August 2010 had delivered a total of 20 A320s and five A319s.
The production rate is expected to increase to four aircraft per month
by 2012. Unit production cost at the new assembly line is reported to
be higher than that in Europe at present, although costs will likely
decrease over time, but the facility is intended to produce aircraft only
for the Chinese market (Ma, 2009). Thus, Airbus clearly established it
as a vehicle for increasing its share of the Chinese market rather than
to create a manufacturing cost advantage for itself.<br><br>
ERJ-145<br><br>
Harbin Embraer Aircraft Industry Company (HEAI), a joint venture
between Embraer SA of Brazil and the Harbin Aircraft Industrial
Group (HAIG), an AVIC subsidiary, was created in 2003 and delivered
its first ERJ-145, 50-seat regional jetliner, in February 2004. However,
the venture is said to have struggled from the start. Chinese airlines
have been slow to place orders, and the orders that were received were
often repeatedly postponed for various reasons. At one point, reports
surfaced suggesting that the assembly line was facing closure (Ionides,
2006; Kirby, 2009). Despite a production capacity of 24 aircraft per
year, the facility had delivered only 36 ERJ-145 aircraft as of August
2010, all to Chinese airlines (Ionides, 2006; “Embraer: Green Aviation,”
2010; “HAIGCHarbin Aircraft Industries Group [Harbin Feiji
Gongye Gongsi],” 2010).<br><br>
Helicopters<br><br>
All of China’s current, ongoing helicopter programs are either collaborative
projects with Western partners or derivatives of Western helicopters.<br><br>
The most important partners of the Chinese helicopter industry include U.S.-based Sikorsky Aircraft, French-based Eurocopter, Italian
Agusta Westland, and French engine-maker Turbomeca.<br><br>
According to Wang Bin, the president of Avicopter, AVIC’s helicopter
subsidiary and builder of all Chinese helicopters, Avicopter will
establish a new helicopter industrial base in Tianjin, as the “dragon-head”
for other helicopter manufacturing centers such as Harbin and Jingdezhen.<br><br>
Tianjin will host Avicopter’s top-level R&D facilities, as well as its
sales and customer-support center. Existing manufacturing centers such
as Changhe Aircraft in Jingdezhen and HAIG in Harbin will specialize
in their respective areas of expertise. HAIG will specialize in compositecomponents
manufacturing and assembly, and Changhe will specialize
in digitized manufacturing and the drive train (Ma, 2009, pp. 23C24).<br><br>
Avicopter’s long-term ambition, according to Wang, is to establish
a “unified, internationally competitive brand” for the Chinese helicopter
industry. While establishing one’s own brand does not preclude
international cooperation, it does imply that “collaborative projects
must conform to the product priorities and development strategies of
Avicopter, and that they must contribute to the development of [Avicopter’s]
own brand.” In particular, Wang warns against weakening
Avicopter’s branding strategy in the pursuit of short-term profits (Ma,
2009, p. 25). These remarks may suggest that Avicopter products will
generally receive priority in resource allocation, even if co-production
programs such as HAIG’s Z-15/EC-175 project with Eurocopter may
have more ready access to foreign markets.<br><br>
Finally, it is worth noting that the production capacity of Chinese
helicopter manufacturers remains rather limited at present. Changhe
Aircraft―one of China’s two major centers of helicopter production―
has undergone steady expansion in recent years and expects to acquire
the capacity to produce 30 light helicopters, 10 medium helicopters,
and 15 heavy helicopters annually by 2012 (Yu, 2008, p. 67). For comparison,
Bell Helicopter produces about 200 helicopters per year at its
Mirabel plant alone (“About Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Limited,”
2010).<br><br>
Current Chinese helicopter programs are described below.<br><br>

Z-8<br><br>
The Changhe Z-8 is a medium transport helicopter developed from
the French SA 321 Super Frelon, acquired by the People’s Liberation
Army (PLA) Navy in 1977C1978. Development of the Chinese copy
of the SA 321 began in the late 1970s, but because of financial difficulties,
first flight did not occur until December 1985. The model was not
certified for design finalization until 1994. The Z-8 is identical to the
Super Frelon in appearance, and the basic model is powered by three
WZ-6 turboshafts (Chinese copies of the Turboméca 3C III), each
rated at 1,512 hp (1,128 kW). Several dozen examples in at least six
variants are serving in various branches of the PLA (“Zhi-8 Transport/
SAR Helicopter,” 2009).<br><br>
Z-9<br><br>
The Z-9 series has been built by HAIG since the early 1980s and is
possibly the most produced helicopter in China, with more than 200
aircraft delivered to both military and civilian customers. The original
Z-9 was a license-built version of the Eurocopter AS365N Dauphin II
twin-engine light utility helicopter. The Z-9B is an “indigenized” variant
with 71.9 percent Chinese-made content. More than 150 Z-9Bs or
its derivatives are believed to have been delivered to the PLA (“Zhi-9
Utility Helicopter,” 2009).<br><br>
Z-11<br><br>
The Changhe Z-11 is a 2,000-kg-class lightweight utility helicopter
modeled after the French AS 350B Squirrel, with certain structural
modifications. Development began in 1991, and first flight took place
in late 1994. The design was finalized in 2000. The Z-11 is powered by
a domestically produced WZ-8D turboshaft rated at 510 kW. Several
variants have been developed, most of which have been produced for
the PLA (“Zhi-11 Utility Helicopter,” 2007).<br><br>
HC120/EC120 Colibri<br><br>
The HAIG HC120/EC120 Colibri is a lightweight, single-engine helicopter
developed by an industrial partnership comprising Eurocopter, HAIG, and Singapore Technologies Aerospace. Development began in
1993, and first flight took place in 1997 (“HC120 Utility Helicopter,”
2007).<br><br>
Mi-171 Family<br><br>
Sichuan Lantian Helicopter Co., Ltd., in Chengdu, Sichuan, a joint
venture established in 2007 with Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant JSC,
assembles Russian Mi-171-series helicopters, including the Mi-171,
Mi-17V5, and Mi-17V7, from kits. The Mi-171 series is a multirole
medium-lift helicopter capable of carrying about 4,000 kg of payload.<br><br>
Under the initial contract, 20 helicopters will be assembled. This was
originally to have been accomplished in 2008, but the first two helicopters
were not delivered until December 2009. In a second stage of
the program, 60 more helicopters will be produced (“SLHC―Sichuan
Lantian Helicopter Company,” 2010; Grevatt, 2009).<br><br>
Z-15/EC-175<br><br>
The HAIG Z-15/Eurocopter EC-175 is a 6-ton-class medium utility
helicopter co-developed by HAIG and Eurocopter as a 50-50 joint venture.
Development began in 2006, and the first prototype made its first
flight in 2009. Two assembly lines will be built, one in China and one
in France (“Zhi-15 [EC 175] Medium Helicopter,” 2008).<br><br>
AC313<br><br>
The Avicopter AC313 is a triple-engine, 13.8-ton civil transport helicopter
developed from the Z-8 military helicopter, itself a 1980s derivative
of the Aerospatiale SA321 Super Frelon. Powered by three Pratt
& Whitney Canada PT6B-67A turboshafts, it is the largest helicopter
developed in China to date. First flight took place in March 2010
(Francis, 2010b). The AC313 makes extensive use of composite materials―
roughly 50 percent by volume―and is equipped with a modern
integrated avionics system (Peng, 2010, p. 15). Avicopter plans to certify
the AC313 for the European and North American markets. <br><br>


AC310<br><br>
The Avicopter AC310 is a 1-ton, single-piston-engine light utility helicopter
currently in development. No first flight has been reported (Wu,
2009, p. 21).<br><br>
AC301A<br><br>
The Avicopter AC301A is a two-ton, single-engine helicopter derived
from the Changhe Z-11, with structural optimizations, an indigenous
rotor system, an improved engine, and modernized avionics. The model
is currently in development, and no first flight has been reported (Wu,
2009, p. 21).<br><br>
Other<br><br>
An unnamed heavy transport helicopter with an internal cargo capacity
of 10 tons and an external carrying capacity of 13 tons is reportedly
being designed. Development of this new helicopter is not expected to
be completed until 2020 (Wu, 2009, p. 21).<br><br>
Fixed-Wing General Aviation Aircraft<br><br>
To date, developments in fixed-wing general aviation aircraft in China
have been limited. China does not produce any business jets, and there
is apparently no business jet program in development. As of late 2009,
China had just under 800 fixed-wing general aviation aircraft, most of
which appear to be light aircraft of foreign origin. For decades, fixedwing
general aviation aircraft in China were limited to Shijiazhuang
Y-5s (copies of the An-2 Colt biplane) and Y-11s (a high-wing twinpiston-
engine utility aircraft). China’s first indigenously developed
agricultural aircraft, the Hongdu N5A, did not make its first flight
until 1989 (Qi, Xiao, and Xu, 2008, p. 18). Fixed-wing general aviation
aircraft currently in production are described below. <br><br>

Y-5B<br><br>
The Shijiazhuang Y-5B, made by AVIC subsidiary General Aviation
Co., is an updated variant of the Y-5 biplane, equipped with newer avionics
and a more powerful engine.<br><br>
Y-12<br><br>
The HAIG Y-12 is a domestically designed high-wing twin-engine
turboprop utility aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight of approximately
5,300 kg. The engines are made by Pratt & Whitney Canada.<br><br>
As of October 2009, at least 145 had been built, most of which were
exported to countries including Iran, Kenya, Sri Lanka, and Zambia
(“HAI Y-12,” 2010).<br><br>
N5<br><br>
The Hongdu N5A is a single-seat agricultural aircraft with an effective
payload of 900 kg. It is powered by a single Lycoming IO-720 piston
engine and made its first flight in 1989. Only about 20 of these aircraft
have been built. An improved version, the N5B, is powered by a Czech
Walter M601F turboprop engine, which increases the plane’s payload
to 1,500 kg. The N5B made its official first flight in July 2008 (“HAIC
N-5,” 2010).<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">Chapter Four The Role of Foreign Firms in the Development of China’s Commercial Aviation Manufacturing Industry</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The aviation industry requires advanced, high-quality products that
are produced at the minimum possible cost. Simply having cheap labor
available is in most cases not sufficient to be competitive. The technologies
for the most advanced products, such as turbine blades, composite
materials, and complete integrated systems, are closely held by the
companies that developed them. Designs and production technologies
for other types of products may be more widely available or easier to
develop, but here, the key is being able to produce them with sufficient
precision, quality, and efficiency to be competitive.<br><br>
Foreign firms have played an important role in the development
of China’s capabilities in these areas. The most basic role is simply providing
a market for the products of China’s aviation manufacturers.<br><br>
This gives them an opportunity to acquire the knowledge that comes
from repeatedly manufacturing the same product (often referred to as
“learning by doing”) and from being forced to continuously improve
quality and cost-efficiency in order to remain competitive, while being
reimbursed for the cost of acquiring these skills (i.e., by selling their
products to the foreign firms). If the price received exceeds manufacturing
and delivery costs, any remaining profits can be reinvested in
acquiring the capability to produce new products or in improving the
quality or production efficiency of existing products. In some cases, the
foreign purchaser may also provide more direct assistance in manufacturing
technology or quality control.<br><br>

Manufacturing and R&D joint ventures provide additional
opportunities for Chinese firms to learn. In a manufacturing joint venture,
the foreign partner typically supplies the production design and
management expertise, while the Chinese partner provides the facility
and labor. Thus, the Chinese partner has an opportunity to learn
how to efficiently produce a line of products it was previously unable
to produce. The drawback of manufacturing joint ventures is that they
are often effectively controlled by the foreign partner, which limits the
Chinese partner’s ability to steer the venture toward product areas that
are of interest to the Chinese parent (or to use the product to supply
clients in China’s defense sector).<br><br>
An R&D joint venture provides an opportunity for the Chinese
partner to learn not only how to produce a specific line of products,
but also how to design and develop entirely new lines of products.
Thus, from the perspective of the Chinese partner, R&D joint ventures
provide the greatest opportunity to assist the growth of its production
capabilities.<br><br>
Foreign firms can also assist the development of China’s aviation
manufacturing capabilities by being acquired by Chinese aviation
companies. The acquiring Chinese firm theoretically has access to
all of the foreign firm’s manufacturing technology and R&D capabilities.
However, transferring these capabilities to the Chinese parent may
present practical challenges, including technology export restrictions
in the home country of the foreign firm.<br><br>
Many aviation technologies are inherently dual-use. Thus, to the
extent to which foreign firms are contributing to the capability of Chinese
companies to produce civilian aviation products, they are also
contributing to China’s capability to produce military products. These
military products could include whole systems, such as transport aircraft
or utility helicopters, or important subsystems and components.<br><br>
In addition, although North American and European countries restrict
the transfer of weapons technologies to China, the restrictions vary by
country. This variability has enabled China to acquire from other countries
technologies that the U.S. government would not have allowed
American companies to transfer. Specific examples include Eurocopter’s
assistance to China in developing the rotor system for a new helicopter that was later determined to have assisted in the development
of a new attack helicopter, and Turbomecca’s collaboration with AVIC
to develop a turboshaft engine for a military transport helicopter, thus
avoiding a potential U.S. embargo on the Pratt & Whitney engine the
helicopter was originally designed to use.<br><br>
There is no question, therefore, that foreign involvement in China’s
aviation manufacturing industry is contributing to the development of
China’s military aerospace capabilities. There is also little doubt that
this is a deliberate policy of the Chinese government. This is not to say
that encouraging foreign involvement in China’s aviation manufacturing
industry is simply a ruse to facilitate the development of China’s
military aerospace industry. Rather, encouraging foreign involvement
in China’s aviation manufacturing industry serves two equally important
purposes for the Chinese government: (1) it facilitates the development
of a highly valued commercial sector, as part of China’s economic
development strategy, and (2) it aids the development of China’s military
aerospace industry.<br><br>
Chinese Government Policies Toward Foreign Aviation<br><br>
Manufacturing Companies<br><br>
International aerospace sales historically have involved not just the participating
firms, but also the governments of the countries in which
they are based. Many airlines are owned and operated by governments,
and national governments, even in nominally free-market countries
such as the United States, see it as their responsibility to promote the
overseas sales of their nations’ products, particularly high-value-added
goods such as airliners. Deregulation and market competition have
diminished the government’s role in aircraft sales but certainly have
not eliminated it.<br><br>
Japan is a prime example of government influence on airplane
sales. Since the 1970s, the Japanese government has subsidized three
Japanese manufacturers―Mitsubishi, Fuji, and Kawasaki Heavy
Industries―in taking on growing roles as major suppliers to Boeing,
producing 15 percent of the 767, 22 percent of the 777, and 35 percent of the 787 (Newhouse, 2007, pp. 28, 171C172). This has involved the
transfer of significant wing design experience and composite technology.<br><br>
Boeing has greatly benefited from the arrangement, with the dominant
share of large commercial aircraft sales to Japan, access to lowcost
capital, and risk-sharing with the three Japanese manufacturers
(Newhouse, 2007, p. 61).<br><br>
Airbus, itself, was predicated on the distribution of design and
manufacturing efforts across companies from the four original national
partners: France, Germany, Great Britain, and Spain (Morrison, 2010).<br><br>
Historically, national carriers in the same four countries purchased primarily
Airbus planes, but aviation deregulation and low-cost carriers
have diversified the EU market for large commercial aircraft. Further,
work or technology distribution is difficult for Airbus, as it has to balance
that with the interests of the four major partner nations (Karp,
2007).Recognizing that its aerospace industry is not yet capable of
designing and producing large commercial aircraft that are competitive
with modern Airbus and Boeing products, China’s government
has allowed its airlines to import such aircraft since the 1980s. However,
the Chinese government has also used the purchase of large
commercial aircraft to pursue other goals. In the past, for example,
the Chinese government has suggested that large orders for Boeing
planes hinged on the renewal of Most Favored Nation trading status
(Newhouse, 2007, pp. 182C183). More recently, Beijing has suggested
that Boeing’s success in China may be jeopardized by political friction
over Taiwan (Heim, 2005). In addition, China’s central government,
with hopes of modernizing its aerospace industry, has attempted to
leverage large commercial aircraft purchases in exchange for arrangements
that it hopes will lead to technology transfer. Tempting airplane
manufacturers with the huge potential market in China, the
Chinese government has encouraged producers of large commercial
aircraft to establish manufacturing and assembly joint ventures with
state-owned aerospace corporations. Often, this has taken the form of
domestic assembly or subcomponent production, e.g., the McDonnell
Douglas MD-80/90 assembly agreements and past Boeing component
contracts. The technology transfer associated with these arrangements, however, was limited to manufacturing and production methods. The
same is true of the much-touted Airbus final assembly line recently
opened in Tianjin. According to industry reports, all major parts are
manufactured at Airbus’s plant in Hamburg and shipped to Tianjin
only for final assembly (Francis, 2008).<br><br>
Since the late 1990s, therefore, the Chinese government has
encouraged joint ventures with the hope of increasing technology
transfer. These policies have been only partially successful, however.<br><br>
Most of the aviation joint ventures established in China have involved
older systems and still consist primarily of assembly operations. Key
technologies and components such as engines or avionics are manufactured
in the West and imported into China for assembly. It should also
be pointed out that while technology transfers of this type do help to
elevate China’s commercial aerospace capabilities from a very low base,
their direct impact on Chinese military capabilities is even more limited,
as the most critical military aerospace technologies are unlikely
to be transferred via commercial avenues. Stealth, for instance, is not
directly relevant to commercial aviation, and the same is true for sensor
fusion and networking multiple aircraft. Basic engine technology is
common to both commercial and military aircraft, but design goals
for affordable, highly efficient commercial turbofans are quite different
from those for high-performance military engines.<br><br>
Nonetheless, by their very nature, joint ventures offer a potential
mechanism for evading U.S. export controls, and although the
majority of joint ventures between Western aerospace corporations and
Chinese entities to date have been in civilian areas with limited military
relevance, the possibility clearly exists for technology transfers of a
more military character. The Chinese certainly appear highly conscious
of the military implications of various ventures. Thus, while projects
of a predominantly civilian nature are generally handled on commercial
terms, those of more significant dual-use value are conducted with
greater attentiveness to China’s security objectives. For example, for
its Z-15/EC-175 medium utility helicopter project with Eurocopter,
China is currently working on replacing the aircraft’s original Pratt &
Whitney engine with a domestically produced model jointly developed with Safran Turbomeca, reportedly as a hedge against possible U.S.<br><br>
sanctions once the helicopter enters PLA service (Morris, 2010).
In addition, the technology level of Western aerospace joint ventures
in China has increased steadily over time. China has arguably
taken a new approach with its ARJ21 regional jet and C919 airliner
projects. While both programs involve significant outsourcing to U.S.
and EU suppliers for advanced components such as engines and avionics,
a condition for being selected as a supplier is often that a joint
venture with a local partner be set up and local production facilities be
established (Mecham and Anselmo, 2010). These new ventures may
bring with them significantly newer technologies.<br><br>
Although Western aerospace companies are generally tight-lipped
about the details of their China strategies, and the specific contents
of commercial agreements are rarely divulged, a correlation between
major aircraft sales and local subcontracting clearly exists, suggesting
that offset arrangements are indeed a major consideration in many
deals. In this regard, the competition between Boeing and Airbus is the
most visible and instructive. In 1995, Boeing held a commanding lead
over Airbus in the Chinese market, accounting for roughly 60 percent
of the Chinese commercial fleet and more than 80 percent of all new
orders (“China and Boeing Partnership Delivering Value,” 1995), while
Airbus held a mere 7 percent market share with only 29 planes sold
(“Airbus in China,” 2010). By 2010, however, Airbus’s market share
had risen to over 43 percent, while Boeing’s share had fallen to roughly
55 percent (World Aerospace Database). In media interviews, industry
experts rarely discuss the role of offsets in the competition between
Boeing and Airbus, pointing instead to factors such as the lack of Chinese
cultural and linguistic expertise at senior levels of Boeing management,
Boeing’s sometimes short-sighted preoccupation with cost
control, Boeing’s perceived complacency in customer relations, and
even the entry-visa difficulties experienced by Chinese airline executives
after the 9/11 attacks. For its part, Boeing management dismisses
the Chinese complaints as routine disagreements between buyers and
sellers and attributes Airbus’s success to its strategy of “flooding the
market with surplus production at discount prices” (Heim, 2005). <br><br>


All of the factors discussed above probably play a role in success in
the Chinese market, but the key appears to be an aggressive program
of local production. For example, in 2005, a group of Chinese airlines
contracted with Boeing to purchase up to 60 Boeing 787 Dreamliners,
a deal worth $7.2 billion at nominal list prices (Gates, 2005). Later the
same year, it was announced that Boeing had selected a number of Chinese
manufacturers as suppliers to the 787 program, including several
single-source contracts on some of the largest components awarded to
a Chinese supplier to date. In all, Boeing sold a total of 117 aircraft to
Chinese airlines that year, making 2005 Boeing’s most successful year
in China to date (“Orders and Deliveries―User Defined Reports”).<br><br>
That same year, however, Airbus secured an order for 150 A320
airliners from China in a deal valued at close to $10 billion (“Airbus in
China,” 2010). It was subsequently revealed that Airbus had reached
an agreement with China to establish its first final assembly line outside
of Europe in Tianjin, and Airbus was rewarded with a contract for
another 150 A320s and 20 A350s in 2006. In 2007, French President
Nicholas Sarkozy returned from a state visit to China with the largest
Airbus order from China to date, a $17.4 billion contract for 110
A320s and 50 wide-body A330s. Most recently, Chinese president Hu
Jintao concluded another agreement with Airbus during his November
2010 state visit to France, an order for 50 A320s, 42 A330s, and 10
A350s valued at $14 billion, with half of the A320s to be assembled in
China (Fouquet and Viscusi, 2010). By comparison, during the same
period (2006C2010) Boeing sold a total of only 287 airliners in China
(“Orders and Deliveries―User Defined Reports”).<br><br>
In conclusion, Chinese government leverage over large commercial
aircraft sales has caused Boeing and Airbus to transfer older production
and assembly technology to China, but no Chinese companies
are yet Tier 1 suppliers to Boeing or Airbus. To increase technology
transfer, COMAC is partnering and establishing joint ventures with
many Western companies through the ARJ21 and C919 projects.<br><br>
However, those Western companies have a vested interest in maintaining
control of their core intellectual property, which likely explains
why most of the technologies planned for the C919 are, with a few exceptions, already currently deployed in modern airliners (Mecham
and Anselmo, 2010).<br><br>
It should also be pointed out that the interests of Chinese stateowned
enterprises are not identical to those of the Chinese government.<br><br>
This is most obvious in the case of China’s state-owned airlines,
which have resisted large-scale commitments to the ARJ21 and C919
despite the central government’s desire to establish COMAC as one of
the world’s leading manufacturers of regional jets and airliners. Similarly,
AVIC has been pursuing its own jet transport projects, which
would compete with those of COMAC.<br><br>
Joint Ventures and Cooperative R&D Activities<br><br>
Joint ventures with foreign enterprises came relatively late to the Chinese
aviation industry. The first joint venture in this sector was established
in 1996, when Pratt & Whitney partnered with the Chengdu
Engine Group Company to establish a production facility in Chengdu
to produce components for aircraft engines and industrial gas turbines.<br><br>
The initial investment was only $25.1 million. Since that time, however,
foreign investment in the Chinese aviation sector has expanded
rapidly, and today most major Western commercial aircraft manufacturers
and aviation subsystems suppliers have established joint ventures
in China.<br><br>
Joint ventures are frequently regarded as an effective vehicle for
Western companies attempting to gain access to the Chinese market.<br><br>
Certainly, Chinese aviation industry leaders have made no secret of
their desire to trade market access for technology, and joint ventures
are their vehicle of choice for gaining access to advanced Western technologies.<br><br>
Naturally, partnerships in technological areas of particular
concern to the Chinese have received the highest priority. One such
area is aircraft engines: The earliest joint ventures in the aviation sector,
spearheaded by Pratt & Whitney, were with engine component producers.<br><br>
Since then, both GE and Rolls-Royce have established joint
ventures in China and greatly expanded local procurement. Another
area is composite-materials manufacturing techniques. Both Boeing and Airbus have established joint ventures specializing in composite
components, and Airbus has recently transferred the technology for
manufacturing the entire composite wing of the A320 airliner to its
joint-venture composite manufacturing center in Harbin.<br><br>
It should be noted, however, that joint ventures per se do not
guarantee effective market access. Those that do not provide access to
coveted technologies or―even more problematically―are perceived to
compete against domestic producers are not likely to receive preferential
treatment and may indeed face severe obstacles. In this regard,
the case of Embraer’s joint-venture production line in China can be
instructive. Established in 2003, the venture is said to have struggled
from the start. Chinese airlines were slow to place orders, and many
of the orders that were received were repeatedly postponed for various
reasons. Despite a production capacity of 24 aircraft per year, the facility
had delivered only 36 ERJ-145 aircraft as of August 2010. Embraer’s
lack of success is likely related to the anticipated arrival of COMAC’s
ARJ21 regional jet, which has undoubtedly influenced the procurement
decisions of Chinese airlines, as they expect to be required to
place orders for the ARJ21.<br><br>
It is also worth noting that Western aerospace companies have
been generally cautious about transferring advanced technology to
China or setting up joint ventures in critical areas. However, a turning
point may have been have reached with the COMAC C919 project.<br><br>
Unlike the ARJ21 program, which has sourced directly from Western
suppliers, COMAC management has made it explicitly clear that
foreign bidders on the C919 program are expected to form joint ventures
with Chinese partners, especially in high-technology areas such
as advanced materials and flight control systems, where Chinese technology
is lagging. In areas of less concern, the Chinese are content with
traditional subcontracting or other work-share arrangements, although
according to COMAC Deputy General Manager Wu Guanghui, local
production is considered a minimum requirement for foreign suppliers
to the C919 program (Zhang, 2010, p. 34).<br><br>
In response, a whole spate of new joint ventures has been
announced between Western aerospace suppliers and AVIC subsidiaries,
the most notable of which is the joint venture between CFM (itself a joint venture between GE and Snecma of France) and AVIC
Commercial Aircraft Engines Co. (ACAE) to assemble the LEAP-X1C
engine in Shanghai. ACAE is said to have started building a $472 million
R&D center in Shanghai and hopes to start building “homegrown
engines” (presumably a locally produced version of the LEAP-X) for
the C919 in 2016. Every C919 contract awarded to a foreign bidder
has been awarded to a joint-venture entity. And a number of companies
that had not established manufacturing joint ventures in China―
including Nexcelle, Goodrich, Parker Aerospace, Rockwell Collins,
and Liebherr―have recently entered into joint-venture agreements in
connection with their C919 bids. A summary of international partners
in the ARJ21 and C919 programs is provided in Tables 4.1 and 4.2.
Detailed information regarding major current and prospective
joint ventures and cooperative R&D activities between Chinese and
foreign companies that we were able to identify is provided below.<br><br>

<a href= "pic30.html">Table 4.1 International Partners in the ARJ21 Program</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic31.html">Table 4.2 Major International Partners in the C919 Program</a><br><br>

U.S. Companies<br><br>
Alcoa, Inc.<br><br>
According to an October 2009 announcement, Alcoa and COMAC
are “jointly exploring” technology solutions for the design and development
of the C919. Through a technology cooperation agreement,
the two companies are examining advanced aluminum structural concepts,
designs, and alloys for the new aircraft (“Alcoa and COMAC
Explore Leading Technology Solutions for C919, China’s Largest Passenger
Aircraft,” 2009).<br><br>
The Boeing Company<br><br>
Boeing China, Inc., is based in Beijing. It includes representatives of
Boeing organizations such as Government Affairs, Commercial Airplane
Sales, Marketing, Business Development, Commercial Aviation
Services, Alteon, Jeppesen, and Communications. As of October
2009, there were 150 Boeing employees in China and more than 6,100
employees at Boeing-related businesses (subsidiaries and joint ventures)
(Fetters-Walp, 2009, p. 13). <br><br>

Boeing has the following joint ventures in China:<br><br>
 9-percent interest in Taikoo Aircraft Engineering Co., Ltd.
(TAECO), Xiamen, an aircraft maintenance, conversion (passenger
to freighter), and repair facility with more than 5,000
employees.<br><br>
 60-percent interest in Boeing Shanghai Aviation Service Co.,
Ltd. (BSAS), a joint venture with Shanghai Airlines (15 percent)
and the Shanghai Airport Authority (25 percent). BSAS performs
passenger-to-freighter conversions; upgrades to interiors, avionics,
and entertainment systems; line maintenance; and heavy maintenance checks. Construction of the facility began in 2007 with
an initial total investment of $85 million. The company has more
than 120 employees.<br><br>
 88-percent interest (expanded from 40 percent after Boeing bought
out former joint-venture partner Hexcel and made additional
investments) in Boeing Tianjin Composites Co., Ltd., Tianjin, a
joint venture of Boeing and AVIC for secondary composite structures
and interior parts for the full range of Boeing aircraft. First
deliveries started in 2002. In 2008, Boeing invested an additional
$21 million in facility expansion, doubling the size of the original
plant and increasing its production capacity by 60 percent. The
new plant will employ roughly 1,000 workers (“Boeing Tianjin
Composite Materials Facility Undergoes Expansion,” 2008, p. 9).<br><br>
In addition to the subcontracting and joint-venture activities
described earlier, Boeing provides technical expertise and international
operational experience in aviation safety, efficiency, reliability, and
quality to Chinese airlines, regulatory authorities, and industry. This
technology transfer helps ensure flight safety, reliability, and efficiency
and the production of safe, high-quality airplane hardware. Boeing
directly supports CAAC in its development of International Civil Aviation
OrganizationCcompliant aviation laws for China, civil aviation
regulations, and various safety enhancement plans. Boeing works with
CAAC on advanced air traffic systems to enhance the safety and efficiency
of China’s air traffic system. Some specific projects include the
development of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)Cstyle training
center for flight and maintenance inspectors; the development of
CAAC’s automatic dependent surveillanceCbroadcast (ADS-B, a cooperative
surveillance technique for air traffic control) implementation
plans; and a number of Required Navigation Performance demonstration
flights into high-altitude airports in Tibet (“Dawn of a New Age,”
2010).<br><br>
In addition, Boeing has reportedly provided professional training
worth several hundred million dollars to more than 37,000 Chinese
aviation professionals since 1993, at no charge to China. An executive
development program for senior CAAC and Chinese airline managers was launched in 1998 and is still ongoing. Annual senior executive
development programs have also been conducted for Chinese aviation
industry executives from AVIC. Other training programs supported by
Boeing include the Boeing Masters of Business Administration (MBA)
program for junior and mid-level officials from the Chinese aviation
sector and a three-year internship program launched in 2008 for 60
Boeing Fellows, half from the United States and half from China
(“Boeing’s Investments in China,” 2010).<br><br>
Boeing is also a leading participant in the U.S.CChina Aviation
Cooperation Program (ACP), a partnership of CAAC, the U.S. government,
and various American aerospace firms launched in 2004. The
program conducts executive development, energy conservation seminars,
flight standards programs, and various other training programs
for Chinese aviation sector personnel. Boeing has also established a
number of training and technology development programs in partnership
with several Chinese universities (“Boeing’s Investments in
China,” 2010).<br><br>
Eaton Corporation<br><br>
Eaton has the following joint ventures in China:<br><br>
 49-percent interest in a new joint venture with Shanghai Aircraft
Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (SAMC), a COMAC subsidiary,
announced in July 2010 (“Eaton Corporation and Shanghai Aircraft
Manufacturing Co., Ltd. Announce a Joint Venture,” 2010).
The project will be based in Shanghai and will focus on the R&D,
production, and support of fuel and hydraulic conveyance systems
for the COMAC C919 program and the global civil aviation
market in general. Total program value for the C919 project,
including aftermarket opportunities, is estimated at $1.8 billion,
based on an anticipated volume of 2,500 aircraft. The joint venture
is the first for a COMAC enterprise with a foreign company.<br><br>
 51-percent interest in Eaton Electrical (ZhongShan) Co., a joint
venture with MingYang Electrical Appliances Co., located in
Zhongshan, Guangdong. Established in 2005, the joint venture
produces medium-voltage switchgear, electrical automation, and protection products (“Eaton Signs Joint Venture Agreement with
MingYang for Medium-Voltage Switchgear Components,” 2005).<br><br>
 55-percent interest in Eaton Senstar Automotive Fluid Connector
(Shanghai) Co., a joint venture with Changzhou Senstar Automobile
Air Conditioner Co., Ltd. Established in 2004, the venture
produces various air-conditioning and power-steering components
(“Eaton Plans Joint Venture with Changzhou Senstar
Automobile Air Conditioner Co., Ltd. in China,” 2004).<br><br>
 Unspecified interest in Shanghai Eaton Engine Components Co.,
a three-partner venture with Nittan Valves of Japan and Huamu
Township near Shanghai. Formed in 1998, the firm produces
engine valves and hydraulic lifters.<br><br>
In addition, Eaton is engaged in various collaborative research
projects with Chinese universities and research institutions. In 2008,
Eaton established a global R&D center in Suzhou, one of its three
global R&D centers. The Eaton Suzhou Center was initially staffed
with 100 researchers, and the number was expected to increase by 40
percent by 2010. The product design team was to engage in the R&D
of vacuum circuit-breakers, medium-voltage components and systems,
switchgears, uninterruptable power supplies, industrial control products,
etc. (“Eaton Electrical Suzhou New Facility to Operate as Global
R&D Center,” 2008).<br><br>
GE Aviation<br><br>
GE has the following joint ventures in China:<br><br>
 51-percent interest in GE Engine Services (Xiamen) Co., Ltd.,
a joint venture with a Chinese consortium led by China Eastern
Airlines (30 percent) and Hainan Airlines (10 percent). The
facility, which began operations in 2001, provides maintenance,
repair, and overhaul (MRO) services for the CFM56 family of jet
engines. The joint-venture structure is notable in that China Eastern
provided no initial investment for its 30-percent share except
an agreement to service its engines at the facility (“GE Engine
Services Opens Engine Overhaul and Repair Facility in Xiamen, China,” 2001; “The Last Kilometer: GE Scrambles for the Chinese
Market,” 2001).<br><br>
 50-50 prospective joint venture between Nexcelle and AVIC Aircraft
announced September 2009. Nexcelle is the nacelle jointventure
company created by GE’s Middle River Aircraft Systems
and Aircelle, a Safran group company, while AVIC Aircraft is
engaged in the development of medium/large transport aircraft,
small commercial aircraft, and landing-gear systems and nacelles
in China. The new venture will design and manufacture engine
nacelles and components for the COMAC C919 as well as other
existing aircraft (“AVIC Aircraft and Nexcelle Announce Plans
for a Nacelle Joint Venture in China,” 2009).<br><br>
 50-percent interest in a prospective joint venture with AVIC Systems,
announced in November 2009, to develop the integrated
avionics system for the COMAC C919. The new avionics company
will offer fully integrated, open-architecture avionics and
services for future commercial aircraft programs. Although it will
be headquartered in China, GE claims that the new venture will
create about 200 jobs in the United States (“GE and AVIC Joint
Venture Creates New Global Business Opportunities,” 2009).<br><br>
While many analysts consider the venture to be risky given GE’s
lack of experience in the area, it is also regarded as a “huge deal
[of the type] that has the potential to redefine the avionics market
once every 15 to 20 years” (Layne, 2010).<br><br>
 Undetermined interest in a prospective joint venture between
CFM and ACAE, announced in December 2009, to establish
a final assembly line and engine test facility for the LEAP-X1C
engine selected for the COMAC C919 airliner. ACAE and CFM
have reportedly established a working team to evaluate the scope
and feasibility of the project. This same team will formulate the
business plan and develop the legal structure and operating agreement
for the proposed joint venture (“CFM and ACAE Sign MOU
for LEAP-X1C Assembly Line In China,” 2009). For CFM, the
C919 contract is reportedly valued at $5 billion and may be worth
up to $15 billion over the next 30 years (“CFM Picked to Power
China’s Future Plane,” March 2010). <br><br>



In addition, GE Aviation has been very active in training technicians
from Chinese airlines on GE engine technology and line maintenance
needs. In 1996, GE and CFM partner Snecma opened a
$17 million aero engine maintenance training center in Guanghan,
Sichuan, adjacent to the CAAC Civil Aviation Flying College. The
training center was the first of its kind in China and the third such
GE facility―the other training centers are in Cincinnati and Melun-
Montereau, France. The curriculum offered is reportedly identical to
that at GE’s other training facilities (“Aero Engine Maintenance Training
Center Opens in Guanghan,” 1996). By the end of the 2000s, GE
was training hundreds of Chinese jet engine technicians annually. In
2008, for instance, more than 500 flight-line mechanics and propulsion
engineers from almost 20 Chinese operators received training in
flight-line engine maintenance, engine removal and installation, and
engine borescope procedures. The training occurred at the Guanghan
facility and at GE’s Customer Technical Education Center in Cincinnati.<br><br>
It is said that Chinese airlines routinely send a dozen or more
technicians at a time to spend at least two weeks at the Cincinnati facility
(“GE Training Hundreds of Jet Engine Technicians from Chinese
Airlines,” 2008).<br><br>
Goodrich Corporation<br><br>
Goodrich has the following joint ventures in China:<br><br>
 51-percent interest in Goodrich Asia-Pacific Limited, a Hong

 Unspecified interest in the CEA Honeywell Aircraft Wheels and
Brakes Repair and Overhaul Co., a joint venture with China Eastern
Airlines launched in December 1995. The company specializes
in MRO services of aircraft wheels, brakes, and other related
components, as well as carbon-brake refurbishment (“Aerospace”).<br><br>
 Unspecified interest in CRIAA Honeywell (Nanjing) Aero-
Accessories Co., a joint venture launched in April 1997 with
AVIC subsidiary China Research Institute of Aero Accessories
(CRIAA) with an initial investment of $11.7 million. The company
develops and produces commercial aircraft environmental
control systems (ECS) for the domestic and export markets and
produces aircraft parts for export, including Boeing 737 hightemperature-
alloy heat-exchanger flanges and pressure-sensor
bosses and aluminum duct assemblies for Boeing 737 and 757
aircraft (“Aerospace”; “CRIAA Honeywell: We Compete Only
Against Ourselves”).<br><br>
 50-percent interest in a prospective joint venture with AVIC subsidiary
Flight Automatic Control Research Institute (FACRI)
to supply the fly-by-wire control system for the COMAC C919,
announced in July 2010. According to Chinese reports, the new
venture will be based in Xi’an, with $32 million in registered
capital and more than $100 million in initial development funds
(Honeywell will invest $40 million). The company intends to
supply the export market until the C919 enters production, after
which it expects 60 percent of contracts to be domestic (“Honeywell
to Supply Flight Control System for the C919 Large Airliner,”
2010).<br><br>
According to company statements, Honeywell’s Aerospace division
is actively developing local sourcing and engineering projects with
leading Chinese aerospace manufacturers and universities. Honeywell
has collaborated for many years with the Shanghai-based China Aeronautical
Radio Electronics Research Institute (CARERI) on air traffic control responder systems, traffic collision avoidance systems (TCAS),
etc. (Liu, 2009, p. 61). Honeywell also maintains a number of wholly
owned research facilities in China. These include the Honeywell Technology
Solutions LabCChina (HTSL-China), which provides “worldclass
software product development support, research and technology
development, technical consulting and digitization services to Honeywell
businesses worldwide” (“Honeywell Technology Solutions Lab”).<br><br>
The largest department in HTSL-China is the Aerospace Electronic
Systems department, which employs 55 engineers, 30 percent of whom
have more than 5 months’ training or work experience in the United
States. In addition to developing products for Honeywell, the lab also
“helps local customers in China on avionics products/system development/
support by using Honeywell technologies” (“Honeywell Technology
Solutions Lab”). Other Honeywell divisions such as Specialty
Materials, Transportation, and Automation & Control also maintain
specialized research facilities in China.<br><br>
In November 2009, Honeywell opened its China Aerospace
Academy in Shanghai to train aerospace engineers. The courses offered
include Technology, Certification, Program Management, Six Sigma
Management & Leadership Training, Air-Worthiness Training, and
Total Quality Management (“Honeywell China Aerospace Academy
Opens; Provides Training to Customers,” 2009).<br><br>
Parker Aerospace<br><br>
Parker Aerospace has the following joint venture in China:<br><br>
 Unspecified interest in a prospective joint venture with the AVIC
Systems Company to be based in Nanjing, announced in April
2010. The new venture will support the development of the
hydraulic and fuel systems for the C919. A significant portion of
the systems’ component design, testing, manufacture, and integration
will take place at the new facility. The program is expected
to generate more than $2.5 billion in revenue over its life cycle for
Parker (“Parker Aerospace, COMAC, and AVIC Systems Hold
Contract Signing Ceremony for Fuel, Inerting, and Hydraulic
Systems on New C919 Aircraft”). <br><br>

Pratt & Whitney<br><br>
Pratt & Whitney has the following joint ventures in China:<br><br>
 78.3-percent interest in Chengdu Aerotech Manufacturing
Co., Ltd., a joint venture with a Chinese consortium led by the
Chengdu Engine Group Company. With an initial investment
of $25.1 million, it was the first Sino-foreign joint venture in the
aviation industry when it was established in February 1996. The
company produces components for commercial aircraft engines
and industrial gas turbines. Currently it employs more than 200
employees (“Chengdu Aerotech Manufacturing Co., Ltd.”).<br><br>
 20-percent interest in Xi’an Airfoil Technology Co., Ltd., a threepartner
joint venture with the Xi’an Aero-Engine Group (51 percent)
and Israeli-based Pratt & Whitney joint venture Blades
Technology International (29 percent), established in 1997. The
company produces compressor airfoils. With a production capacity
of $60 million in annual sales, the company produces mainly
for export (“Xi’an Airfoil Technology Co., Ltd.”).<br><br>
 Pratt & Whitney (Canada) holds a 49-percent interest in Zhuzhou
South Pratt & Whitney Aero-engine Co., Ltd., a joint venture
with China National South Aero-Engine Co. in Zhuzhou,
Hunan. The joint venture was launched in 1998 and manufactures
components for turboprop aircraft engines. As of 2007, the
company had 217 employees (“Zhuzhou South Pratt & Whitney

Rockwell Collins<br><br>
Rockwell Collins has the following joint ventures in China: <br><br>

 Unspecified interest in a prospective joint venture with China
Electronics Technology Avionics Co., Ltd (CETCA), announced
in July 2010, to provide communications and navigation equipment
for the COMAC C919 project. The prospective venture is
expected to be based in Chengdu, Sichuan (“Rockwell Collins
Selected to Provide Communication and Navigation Systems for
COMAC C919,” 2010).<br><br>
 Unspecified interest in a prospective joint venture with China
Leihua Electronic Technology Research Institute (LETRI),
announced in July 2010, to provide an integrated flight-data
surveillance system for the COMAC C919 project. LETRI, a
research division of AVIC, has previously worked with Rockwell
Collins to assemble and test weather radar, radar antenna
mounts, and TCAS equipment for inclusion in Rockwell Collins’
surveillance systems sold to airlines throughout the world. The
prospective new venture is expected to be based in Wuxi, Jiangsu
(“Rockwell Collins to Provide Integrated Surveillance System for
COMAC C919,” 2010).<br><br>
In connection with its successful bid to supply the C919’s cabin
core system, Rockwell Collins will collaborate with the Shanghai Aero
Measurement-Controlling Research Institute (SAMRI) in the design,
development, and integration of the system. According to Rockwell
statements, the new system will leverage innovations from the Rockwell
Collins Venue Cabin Management System to develop a “nextgeneration
backbone” for the C919’s cabin core system. SAMRI is a
subsidiary of AVIC (“Rockwell Collins Selected to Provide Cabin Core
System for COMAC C919,” 2010).<br><br>
Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation<br><br>
Sikorsky’s industrial cooperation with China dates back to 1995, when
a Chinese consortium led by the Changhe Aircraft Industries Corporation
and the China Helicopter Research and Development Institute
participated in Sikorsky’s Team S-92 project and undertook the design
and manufacture of the S-92’s tail pylon and horizontal stabilizer.<br><br>
China’s role in the project is limited, and the project has not led to significant Sikorsky sales in China. As of 2008, China had purchased
only one S-92A in the offshore oil support role, and between 1998
and 2008, Sikorsky sold only 17 medium helicopters and 24 light helicopters
in China (Zhang, 2008, p. 38; Zhao and Ma, 2009, p. 63).<br><br>
Nevertheless, it is claimed that the project helped the Chinese helicopter
industry take a major step forward in modern manufacturing and
industrial management techniques. After a decade of relatively slow
development, Sikorsky’s Chinese presence received a major boost in
June 2006, when Sikorsky signed an MOU with AVIC II for collaboration
on the development and production of civil helicopters. Several
subcontracts and joint ventures soon followed.<br><br>
In 2003, Sikorsky established a joint-venture subsidiary in Shanghai
with a Chinese private-sector developer of light and ultralight helicopters.<br><br>
Initially, the company was engaged primarily in providing
maintenance services and training classes to Sikorsky’s Chinese customers.<br><br>
In January 2008, the joint venture was reorganized, with AVIC
joining as the lead Chinese partner through its subsidiaries Changhe
Aircraft and Shanghai Xinsheng. The reorganized company had
$6 million in registered capital, with Sikorsky holding a 49-percent
stake. The company expanded its business to provide supply-chain
management services, as well as post-sales customer support to both
Sikorsky’s and Changhe’s civil fleet in China (“AVIC II Joins Shanghai
Sikorsky,” 2008; Chen, 2008).<br><br>
Non-U.S. Companies<br><br>
Airbus SAS<br><br>
Airbus China opened its Beijing office in 1990. It now employs more
than 270 people in China, the majority of whom are Chinese nationals,
and operates a string of local customer-support offices to provide
assistance to airlines. Airbus subsidiaries in China include the Hua-Ou
Aviation Training Centre in Beijing; the nearby Hua-Ou Aviation
Support Centre; the Airbus (Beijing) Engineering Centre (ABEC),
where design work on new Airbus programs is conducted; and, newly
established in October 2009, a logistics center in Tianjin to optimize
supply-chain management for all of Airbus’s production facilities in
China (“Airbus in China”). <br><br>

Airbus has the following joint ventures in China:<br><br>
 70-percent interest in the Airbus (Beijing) Engineering Centre,
a joint venture between Airbus and AVIC. Launched in 2006,
ABEC’s engineers work on specific design packages for new Airbus
programs, including the design and development of the Airbus
A350 XWB. (China is allocated 5 percent of the design and manufacturing
work on the A350 airframe, per a 2007 MOU.) By
2009, the center employed some 200 Chinese engineers (“Industrial
Cooperation and Technology Transfers”).<br><br>
 51-percent interest in Airbus FALC, Tianjin, a joint venture
between Airbus and a Chinese consortium of the Tianjin Free
Trade Zone and AVIC. The facility performs final assembly of
A320-series aircraft (“Industrial Cooperation and Technology
Transfers”).<br><br>
 20-percent interest in Hafei Airbus Composite Material Manufacturing
Center, located in Harbin, a joint venture between
Airbus and a Chinese consortium led by HAIG. The manufacturing
center is intended to supply composite components for the
A350 XWB project, as well as the A320 family. Construction
began in June 2009, and the new plant delivered its first work
package, a set of A320 elevators, in July 2010. The facility will
supply elevators, rudders, and horizontal-tail-plane spars for the
A320 and is also an exclusive supplier for A350 rudders, elevators,
and maintenance doors. The facility expected to employ 100
workers by the end of 2010 and 600 by 2016 (“Airbus Harbin JV
Plant Delivers 1st Work Package,” 2010).<br><br>
In addition, Airbus has provided technical training to thousands
of maintenance engineers, pilots, and cabin crew (many of whom were
from outside China) at its Beijing training center since 1998. Billed
as “the most modern such facility in the country,” the training center
contains two full simulators, one for the A320 family and one for the
A330/A340 family (“Airbus in China”).<br><br>
Airbus has also experimented with other forms of industrial collaboration.
For example, following the cancellation of the Airbus-AVIC
AE31X program in 1998, Airbus invited Chinese participation in the design of the A318, a shortened derivative of the A319 developed as a
low-cost alternative to the AE31X as Airbus’s entry in the regional jets
category. Subsequently, a team of Chinese engineers participated in the
development of the new aircraft (“Airbus in China”).<br><br>
AgustaWestland<br><br>
AgustaWestland is a relative latecomer to China, having delivered only
about 25 helicopters to Chinese operators as of late 2009. Agusta’s
industrial collaboration with China began in 1999, when Agusta was
awarded a $30 million contract to design and develop the transmission
system for the China Medium Helicopter program (“Agusta and
Jiangxi Changhe Aviation Industries Signed a Joint Venture Agreement,”
2004).1 In 2004, Agusta formed a joint venture with Changhe
Aircraft for the production and local support of the Agusta A109 helicopter.<br><br>
As of 2009, the joint-venture company, the Changhe Agusta
Helicopter Co., Ltd., had the capacity for final assembly of the A109, as
well as the ability to manufacture the fuselage and various other components.<br><br>
Agusta is reportedly considering introducing other models for
final assembly in China (Zhao and Ma, 2009, p. 66).<br><br>
Antonov Aeronautical Scientific/Technical Complex
Although Antonov ASTC, of Ukraine, has a long-standing relationship
with the Chinese aviation industry, most of that collaboration
has been focused on the development of military transports such as
the turboprop Y-8. Antonov’s participation in the commercial aircraft
sector has been more limited, although it provided key assistance
in critical areas such as wing design, integral airframe construction
strength analysis, and various wind-tunnel tests for the ARJ21 (“Building
of the First ARJ-21 Designed with the Participation of Antonov Is
Completed,” 2007). However, Antonov does not appear to be involved
in the C919 project, based on available information. As of November
2010, Antonov does not have any known subcontracting or jointventure
relationships with the Chinese aviation industry. <br><br>

Bombardier<br><br>
Bombardier’s presence in China is concentrated primarily in its railtransportation
division, which employs more than 3,500 people
through three joint ventures and seven wholly foreign-owned enterprises.
The company’s China operations are headquartered in Beijing,
and its commercial aircraft and customer-services operations are based
in Shanghai. Its business aircraft operations are based in Hong Kong
(“Bombardier in China”).<br><br>
During the 2007 Paris Air Show, Bombardier Aerospace signed a
risk- and revenue-sharing agreement with AVIC to develop the ARJ21-
900, the 105-seat version of AVIC’s new regional jet (Butterworth-
Hayes, 2010, p. 27). According to company statements, Bombardier
will provide technical assistance in the development of the ARJ21 program.
In 2008, Bombardier gave long-time subcontractor Shenyang
Aircraft Co. design authority on major supplied parts of Bombardier’s
new C-series regional jets. In addition, through its design informationtechnology
system, Bombardier is linking its offices in Montreal to
SAC’s Shenyang offices for online, live knowledge-sharing (“Bombardier
in China: Local Partners and Suppliers”).<br><br>
Embraer SA<br><br>
Embraer SA opened its first representative office in Beijing in May 2000.
Over the next decade, the company established a spare-parts distribution
center in Beijing and opened the first Embraer production facility
outside of Brazil, a joint venture with HAIG in Harbin to produce the
ERJ 145 family of aircraft. As of 2007, the company employed 230
people in China at its various subsidiary units (“Embraer in China”).<br><br>
Embraer has the following joint venture in China:<br><br>
 51-percent interest in Harbin Embraer Aircraft Industry (HEAI),
a joint venture between Embraer and HAIG.<br><br>
The Eurocopter Group<br><br>
Eurocopter’s industrial collaboration with China dates back to 1980,
when its predecessor Aérospatiale contracted with HAIG to produce the 4-ton-class AS365N Dauphin II under license as the Z-9. The program
proved highly successful, and HAIG became Eurocopter’s primary
partner in China. At the same time, Eurocopter became a leading
source of technology for the Chinese helicopter industry, receiving
a $70 million to $80 million contract in 1997 to help develop the rotor
system for a new Chinese medium helicopter, subsequently associated
with the Z-10 attack helicopter (Endres, 2006). Over time, Eurocopter
became the leading foreign helicopter maker in China, accounting for
more than 40 percent of the Chinese civil helicopter fleet as of 2009.<br><br>
Eurocopter senior management acknowledges that the key to the company’s
success lies in its willingness to collaborate on the basis of the
latest available technology (Zhao and Ma, 2009, p. 65).<br><br>
To date, Eurocopter’s joint projects with HAIG include:<br><br>
 Licensed production of the AS365N Dauphin II as the Z-9. The
initial 1980 agreement provided for 48 sets of AS365N kits to be
assembled in Harbin, and in 1993, a follow-on contract for 22
additional sets was signed. In 1992, the Z-9B, an “indigenized”
variant with 71.9 percent Chinese-made content, made its first
flight. It is believed that the PLA subsequently took delivery of
more than 150 Z-9Bs and its follow-on variants. Over time, the
Z-9 became the most produced helicopter series in China, with
over 200 units delivered to military and civilian customers so far.<br><br>
HAIG has also developed several improved variants of the Z-9,
the latest of which is the H450, with an enhanced payload. The
PLA is said to be interested in adopting this variant to replace its
older Z-9s if the program is successful (“Zhi-9 Utility Helicopter,”
2009).<br><br>
 Joint development and co-production of the EC-120/HC-120 in
a three-way partnership between Eurocopter, HAIG, and Singapore
Technologies Aerospace, Ltd. (STAero), contracted since
1993. The EC120 is a single-engine light helicopter with a maximum
takeoff weight of approximately 1,700 kg. Its design is considered
highly advanced, with extensive use of composite materials
and a new-generation shrouded tail rotor. At the time of the project’s launch, it was the first Chinese risk-sharing partnership
in a helicopter program (“HC-120 Helicopter”).<br><br>
Initially HAIG, which has a 24-percent stake in the program,
produced the fuselage and fuel system for the machine,
while Eurocopter (61 percent) was responsible for overall technological
leadership and final assembly. In 2004, a second assembly
line with the capacity to produce 20 aircraft per year was opened
in Harbin, although HAIG continues to supply the fuselages on
all EC120s produced. To date, more than 600 EC120s have been
delivered to customers around the world (Zhao and Ma, 2009,
p. 65). One operator is U.S. Customs and Border Protection,
which has 15 of these aircraft.<br><br>
 Joint development of the EC175/Z-15 7-ton-class medium utility
helicopter, contracted in 2006. The project is a 50-50 joint venture
between Eurocopter and HAIG, with Eurocopter serving as
the technical lead and systems integrator. Eurocopter has responsibility
for the EC175’s main gearbox, tail rotor, avionics, doors,
and transparencies, while HAIG is responsible for the airframe,
tail and intermediate gearboxes, main rotor, fuel system, flight
controls, and landing gears (Zhao and Ma, 2009, p. 65). The first
prototype made its first flight in December 2009 (Dubois, 2010).<br><br>
While all versions of the aircraft were originally expected to
be powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C-67E turboshafts,
in early 2010, French engine-maker Turbomeca confirmed
that it will collaborate with AVIC to develop a new turboshaft
based on the Turbomeca Ardiden engine for the Chinese Z-15.
AVIC will develop the compressor and the engine installation in
Harbin, and Turbomeca will develop the hot section and controls.<br><br>
The new engine, identified as the WZ60, is said to offer 15 percent
better fuel economy. But perhaps even more important for
the Chinese, a Chinese engine would avoid potential U.S. embargoes
on the Pratt & Whitney engine once the Z-15 enters Chinese
military service (Morris, 2010). <br><br>

In addition, since 2002, Eurocopter has been a partner (having
a 34-percent interest) in the CITIC Offshore Helicopter Company
(COHC) General Aviation Maintenance and Engineering Co., a
Shenzhen-based MRO joint venture with COHC. The facility is said
to be the largest helicopter MRO facility in China and the only such
facility in China to receive European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)
certification (Zhao and Ma, 2009, p. 65).<br><br>
Liebherr Aerospace, SAS<br><br>
Liebherr has the following joint ventures in China:<br><br>
 50-percent interest in Liebherr Hangda Aerospace Technologies
(Wuhan) Co., Ltd., a joint venture with the Wuhan Hangda Aero
Science and Technology Development Co. The facility opened in
2007 and provides maintenance service on all Liebherr Aerospace
products, including heat exchangers installed on Airbus, Boeing,
Bombardier, and Embraer aircraft, as well as future COMAC aircraft
operating in China (“Liebherr-Aerospace Establishes Joint
Venture with a Chinese Partner,” 2007).<br><br>
 Unspecified interest in a prospective joint venture with AVIC
subsidiary Landing-gear Advanced Manufacturing Co., Ltd.<br><br>
(LAMC) in Changsha, Hunan, announced in July 2010. The
joint venture will supply the landing-gear system for the COMAC
C919, including the main landing gear and nose landing gear,
extension and retraction system, nose-wheel steering system, and
position and warning system (“Liebherr-Aerospace Selected for
the New Chinese Aircraft Program C919,” 2010).<br><br>
 A technology-cooperation and work-share agreement with AVIC
subsidiary Nanjing Engineering Institute of Aircraft Systems
(NEIAS), announced in July 2010, to supply the air management
system of the COMAC C919. The package will include the
bleed air system, the air-conditioning system, the air-distribution
system, the cabin-pressure control system, the wing anti-ice
system, and the avionics ventilation system. Liebherr hopes that
the work-share partnership established with NEIAS can be used for future projects (“Liebherr-Aerospace Selected for the New
Chinese Aircraft Program C919,” 2010).<br><br>
Rolls-Royce Group PLC<br><br>
Rolls-Royce has the following joint ventures in China:
 Unspecified interest in XR Aero-components, Ltd. (XRA) in
Xi’an, a joint venture with the Xi’an Aero Engine Company,
established in 1996. Rolls-Royce describes XRA as a “high-tech
joint venture” specializing in the manufacture of turbine-nozzle
guide vanes and low-pressure turbine blades for use in Rolls-
Royce engines on various Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Boeing
aircraft. The facility has been in operation since 1998 (“Working
Together,” 2009).<br><br>
 Unspecified interest in Hong Kong Aero Engine Services Limited
(HAESL) in Hong Kong (“Rolls-Royce in Hong Kong,” 2009).<br><br>
Rolls-Royce’s technological partnership with the Chinese aviation
industry dates back to the 1970s, when the company first transferred
overhaul technology for its Spey 512 engine (used on Hawker Siddeley
Trident civilian jetliners) to China and then, in 1975, granted a production
license for the military-use Spey 202 to the Xi’an Aero-Engine
Company, along with 50 complete engines. It took decades for China to
master the production technology for the Spey, however, and in 2001,
another 80 to 90 reconditioned British-made Speys were delivered to
China. Actual production of the Spey 202 (designated the WS9 Qin
Ling in China) in Xi’an apparently did not begin until about 1998. As
of 2008, at least 110 XAC JH-7 fighter-bombers, the only aircraft in
China that uses the Spey, were estimated to have been produced. Since
each JH-7 is equipped with two engines, this would mean that at least
80 Speys had been produced in China at that point, suggesting that the
production technology has now been mastered (“Rolls-Royce China”;
“History,” 2009; “Rolls-Royce Spey,” 2010; “XAE WS9 Qin Ling,”
2010; “XAE―Xian Aero-Engine Corporation,” 2010).<br><br>
Since the 1970s, Rolls-Royce has deepened its relationship with
China. It has developed technical and managerial training programs with a range of Chinese organizations, including AVIC, CAAC, and
several government ministries. In particular, Rolls-Royce collaborates
with CAAC in operating a joint facility in Tianjin, established in 1997,
for the training of technicians, engineers, and managers (“Rolls-Royce
China”; “History,” 2009).<br><br>
In addition, Rolls-Royce is involved in a number of research programs
with Chinese universities and research institutes in the area of
aerospace engine technology. These include the Joint Engineering Team
(JET) program with AVIC and a more recent (February 2009) joint
research project with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) focusing
on new manufacturing techniques and materials for low-pressure
turbine blades. In July 2010, Rolls-Royce signed an MOU with HAIG
regarding collaboration in composite-materials research (“Rolls-Royce:
Procurement in China to Increase Three- to Four-fold over the Next
Five-to-Eight Years,” 2010).<br><br>
The Safran Group<br><br>
Safran Turbomeca and AVIC II started working together in the 1980s,
when Turbomeca granted the China National South Aero Engine Corporation
(SAEC) a production license for the Arriel 1 engine for the
Z-9 helicopter. Today, Turbomeca is the leading helicopter enginemaker
in China, with 500 engines serving in both the civilian and
military sectors, equipping roughly half of the Chinese helicopter fleet
(“Turbomeca [Safran Group] Signs Agreement for Training Programs
in China,” 2009). In 2005, Turbomeca secured a major contract for
200 Arriel 2C turboshaft engines from AVIC II, along with a partial
production license. In connection with the contract, a cooperation
framework agreement was signed, providing for increased collaboration
with the Chinese aerospace engine industry. Turbomeca’s
first manufacturing joint venture in China was the Beijing Turbomeca
Changkong Aero-Engine Control Equipment Co., Ltd., a partnership
with AVIC subsidiary Beijing Changkong Machinery, established in
2006. The facility assembles and tests fuel-control units and hydromechanical
units of turboshaft engines for both Turbomeca and
Beijing Changkong (“Signature Between Turbomeca and Beijing
Changkong Machinery for a Joint Venture Company,” 2006). In late 2009, Turbomeca formed another partnership with the Civil Aviation
Flight University of China (CAFUC). The new venture will develop
a Turbomeca maintenance training program in Chengdu to qualify
advanced line-maintenance engineers (“Turbomeca [Safran Group]
Signs Agreement for Training Programs in China,” 2009). In early
2009, Turbomeca revealed that it was participating in a 50-50 joint
venture with AVIC to develop a new-generation 1,500-kW turboshaft
engine, to be manufactured primarily in China. The project was said
to be the first joint development of an aerospace engine between China
and a Western aerospace company (Zhang and Liu, 2009, p. 50). Subsequently,
Turbomeca confirmed that it was co-developing a derivative
of its Ardiden engine with China to power the Z-15/EC-175 medium
helicopter. The Z-15 is expected to be dual-use, and the new engine
would allow the Chinese to avoid potential U.S. embargoes on its original
Pratt & Whitney engine. Turbomeca engines have already been
licensed by the French government for military export (Morris, 2010).<br><br>
The Safran Group also has the following joint ventures in China:
 51.8-percent interest in the Sichuan Services Aero Engine Maintenance
Co., a Chengdu-based joint venture with the Air China
Group, established in 1999. The facility offers a wide range of
MRO services for CFM56-3, CFM56-5B, and CFM56-7 engines
(“Worldwide―Sichuan Services Aero Engine Maintenance Company
[SSAMC]”).<br><br>
 85-percent interest in the Snecma Xinyi Airfoil Castings Co.,
Ltd., a Guiyang-based joint venture with the Guizhou Xinyi
Machinery Factory, established in July 2006. The plant produces
low-pressure turbine blades, nozzle guide vanes, and low-pressure
turbine seals for the CFM56 family of commercial jet engines
(“Worldwide―Snecma Xinyi Airfoil Castings”). <br><br>

Extent to Which China-Based Production Supplies U.S.<br><br>
Aerospace Firms<br><br>
The value of aerospace imports to the United States from China was
about $421 million in 2009, about 1 percent of total U.S. aerospace
imports. This made China the tenth most important aerospace supplier
to the United States. See Figures 4.1 and 4.2. By contrast, aerospace
exports to China from the United States totaled $5.314 billion in 2009,
or 6.5 percent of U.S. aerospace exports. See Figure 4.3. The disparity
between these figures should not be taken to imply that the United
States is contributing more to China’s aviation industry than China is
contributing to the U.S. aviation industry. The vast majority of aerospace
exports from the United States to China appear to be complete
aircraft sold directly to Chinese airlines. In 2009, Boeing sold 72 large
commercial airplanes to Chinese airlines, including 61 737s, four 747s,
and seven 777s (“Orders and Deliveries”). Boeing does not disclose the
total amount paid for these aircraft, but according to Boeing’s website,
737s cost between $60 million and $80 million, while both the 747
and 777 cost more than $200 million each (“Commercial Airplanes
―Jet Prices”). If the Chinese airlines paid $60 million for each 737
and $200 million for each 747 or 777, the total amount would have
been $5.86 billion, more than actual U.S. aerospace exports to China
that year. Even if the Chinese airlines paid only 90 percent of these
amounts, these sales would account for all but $40 million of U.S.
aerospace exports to China in 2009. Most of the exports from China
to the United States, by contrast, are inputs to final products that are
completed in the United States.<br><br>

<a href= "pic32.html">Figure 4.1 U.S. Aerospace Imports, 2009</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic33.html">Figure 4.2 U.S. Aerospace Imports, 2005C2009</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic34.html">Figure 4.3 U.S. Aerospace Exports, 2005C2009</a><br><br>



Aerospace imports from China grew at an average annual rate
of 25 percent between 2005 and 2009, while total aerospace imports
from all sources grew at an average annual rate of only about 6 percent,
suggesting that China’s share of U.S. aerospace imports will likely
increase rapidly in coming years.<br><br>

Most China-based production that supplies U.S. (and other Western)
aerospace firms comes from either the joint ventures described
above or the various subsidiaries of AVIC. According to figures
released at AVIC’s 2009 company summit meeting, the total value of
the company’s subcontract deliveries in 2008 reached $639 million, a
35-percent year-on-year increase over 2007. More than half of that
value came from engine subcontracts, which accounted for $330 million
(“AVIC Aims to Deepen Reform in 2009,” 2009).<br><br>
To date, Boeing is by far the largest foreign customer of the
Chinese aviation manufacturing industry. According to information
released by Boeing, since the 1980s, Boeing has purchased more than
$1.5 billion of aviation hardware and services from China, and it holds
active contracts with Chinese suppliers valued at more than $2.5 billion.<br><br>
All of Boeing’s commercial aircraft lines now incorporate parts


and assemblies built in China, although most of these parts are relatively
minor. Boeing’s subcontract relationship with China received a
major boost in 2005, after China contracted with Boeing for up to
60 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, a deal worth $7.2 billion at list prices.<br><br>
Soon after, a number of Chinese firms were selected as exclusive,
single-source suppliers for the 787, and Boeing also “introduced” its
existing network of suppliers to Chinese firms, encouraging them to
purchase from Chinese suppliers. To date, U.S.-based Boeing suppliers
with Chinese subcontracting relationships include the Eaton Corp.
(777 fuel-system components), GE (jet engine components and parts
assembly), Goodrich (jet engine fan cowls, 787 nacelle components),
Honeywell (cabin management systems, engine parts, and other avionics
components for the 737 and 757), and Pratt & Whitney (engine
components, such as compressor airfoils).<br><br>

It is worth noting that many of these subcontracts are themselves
correlated with the U.S. supplier’s success in penetrating the Chinese
market. For example, while GE’s purchase of jet engine components in
China reached $284 million in 2007, Chinese engine orders with GE
reached more than $1 billion (list price) that year. In addition, some
of the Chinese production subcontracts increase American exports in
other sectors, and joint ventures with Chinese firms may create jobs
in the United States. The aluminum alloys used for Xi’an Aircraft’s
subcontract for 737 vertical-tail assemblies and Shanghai Aircraft’s
subcontract for horizontal stabilizers, for instance, are sourced mainly
from Alcoa’s production facilities in Indiana and Arizona. And GE’s
new joint venture with AVIC Systems to produce avionics systems will
reportedly create more than 200 jobs in the United States.<br><br>
Finally, although Boeing and many of its U.S.-based first-tier suppliers
have established MRO service facilities in China, most of the
customers who presently use these facilities are Chinese.<br><br>

The major Western aviation-component production subcontracts
and servicing agreements in China that we were able to identify are
described below.<br><br>
U.S. Companies<br><br>
Alcoa, Inc.<br><br>
Alcoa operates a wholly owned fastening-systems manufacturing facility
in Suzhou (Alcoa Fastening Systems (Suzhou) Co., Ltd.), which
began operations in 2006, as well as aerospace service and logistics
facilities in Shanghai (“Alcoa in China”).<br><br>
Alcoa has been a long-term supplier of aluminum products to Chinese
aircraft manufacturers for their Boeing subcontracts. These manufacturers
include the XAC for Boeing 737 vertical-tail assemblies and
the Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Factory for Boeing 737 horizontal-
stabilizer assemblies. However, none of these contracts was sourced
from Alcoa’s China facilities. Instead, the aluminum was produced at
facilities in Indiana, Arizona, and South Korea (“Alcoa Expands Supplier
Relationship with Shanghai Aircraft of China,” 2005). Similarly,
although Alcoa materials are used extensively on the COMAC ARJ21,
all of them are sourced from facilities outside of China. These materials
include advanced heat-treated sheet and plate alloys used throughout the
aircraft from Alcoa’s Davenport, Iowa, plant; extrusions made from proprietary
alloys and process technologies for the wing and fuselage stringers
and floor beams, sourced from Alcoa’s Lafayette, Indiana, Chandler,
Arizona, and Changwon (South Korea) plants; and airfoil castings and
structural components from Alcoa’s power and propulsion plants in
Whitehall, Michigan, and Wichita Falls, Texas (“Alcoa Advanced
Aerospace Alloys and Materials Used on China’s First Home-Produced
Regional Jet, ARJ21-700,” 2008).<br><br>
The Boeing Company<br><br>
According to information released by Boeing, since the 1980s, Boeing
has purchased more than $1.5 billion of aviation hardware and services
from China. Today, Boeing and Boeing suppliers have active supplier
contracts with China’s aviation industry valued at over $2.5 billion,
and Boeing claims to be the largest foreign customer of the Chinese aviation manufacturing industry. All of Boeing’s commercial aircraft
lines now incorporate parts and assemblies built in China. However,
Boeing does not release annual procurement numbers (“Boeing in
China,” 2007).<br><br>
Current Boeing work packages and procurement at Chinese enterprises
include major parts (including some composite parts) on the 787
Dreamliner, the 747-8, and in particular, the 737NG. China is also
the first location for the 747-400 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF)
program, which converts older 747 passenger aircraft into freighters
(“Boeing in China,” 2007). Boeing’s subcontracting relationships in
China are summarized in Table 4.3.<br><br>

<a href= "pic35.html">Table 4.3 Current Boeing Work Packages and Procurement at Chinese-Owned Enterprises</a><br><br>

In 2005, Boeing selected a number of Chinese manufacturers to
be suppliers to the 787 program. These contracts marked several milestones
in Boeing’s relationship with China: For the first time, Chinese
firms were selected as exclusive, single-source suppliers for a major new
airliner, and also for the first time, essential composite structures were
subcontracted to Chinese suppliers. According to Boeing, the value of
the 787 packages in China could reach several hundred million dollars
over the lifetime of the program. In addition, Boeing for the first time
“introduced” its global network of suppliers to Chinese firms, “encouraging
them to engage with Chinese industry.” As a result, China has
gained a “very significant, expanding role in the Boeing supplier network
at all levels” (“Boeing’s Investments in China,” 2010).<br><br>
Cytec Engineered Materials<br><br>
Cytec Engineered Materials operates an aerospace composite-materials
production facility in Shanghai to supply carbon fiber epoxy prepreg
material for commercial transport programs throughout the Asia-
Pacific region (“Cytec Eyes Jumbo Jet Options,” 2009).<br><br>
Eaton Corporation<br><br>
Eaton began its operations in China in 1993 with a joint venture in
Shandong to manufacture steering-control units and hydraulic motors,
a venture that it subsequently acquired. Today, Eaton operates roughly
30 production facilities in China, the majority of which are wholly owned, with about 10,000 employees and total sales approaching
$1 billion in 2010. Eaton’s facilities in China make products for all
of Eaton’s distinct businesses, from aerospace to automotive (“Eaton
in China Fact Sheet”). Eaton is a components supplier to the Chinese
aviation industry and supports other foreign first-tier suppliers on programs
including the ARJ21, the MA60, and the Embraer ERJ145. In
2010, Eaton announced a joint venture with AVIC to supply the fuel
and hydraulic systems for the COMAC C919.<br><br>
Eaton has also developed extensive local sourcing relationships
with Chinese suppliers. Most recently, Eaton signed a six-year supply
agreement with AVIC subsidiary Shenyang Liming Aero-Engine
Group to supply fuel-system components to be used on the Boeing
777 as well as all Airbus aircraft (Liu, 2009, p. 64).<br><br>
General Electric (including CFM International, Nexcelle)<br><br>
General Electric has an extensive presence in China, with more than
50 manufacturing and service facilities in the country employing
some 13,000 employees. In 2009, GE’s total annual revenues in China
exceeded $5.3 billion (“GE in China”).<br><br>
Over the past decade, GE Aviation has emerged as the leading jet
engine supplier in China. As of 2008, there were about 2,000 GE and
CFM engines in service, with an additional 1,000 on order valued at
more than $5 billion (list price) (“GE Jet Engine Backlog Climbs to $5
Billion in China,” 2008). As of September 2010, GE Aviation operated
five facilities in China, including the CFM International Spares Service
Center in Beijing (established in 1996), an on-wing support facility
in Xiamen (established in 1998), an engine-overhaul joint venture
also in Xiamen (established in 1999), the China Operations Center in
Shanghai (established in 2006) to provide customer support, and a new
200,000-sq-ft systems manufacturing facility in Suzhou (established in
2009) to produce autoclaved composite parts, mechanical fabrications,
structure assembly, and civil-aircraft actuation systems (“GE Expands
with New Facility Opening in Suzhou,” 2009).<br><br>
GE Aviation maintains subcontracting relationships with Chinese
manufacturers dating back to 1986. As of September 2010, its most
important local supplier was the Xi’an Aero Engine Corp. (contracted since 1996), designated a manufacturing technology center to supply
components for the CFM56-series jet engines (“CFM56 Sourcing and
Spare Parts Programs Launched in China”). In September 2007, GE
also contracted with AVIC subsidiary Shenyang Liming Aero Engine
Group to supply components and undertake parts assembly and testing
for the CF34-10A engines on the COMAC ARJ21 (“GE: We Believe
in the Potential of the Chinese Market,” 2008, p. 17). In addition,
GE procures various other aviation components from Chinese firms
in Harbin, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Guizhou. In 2007, GE’s purchases
of jet engine components in China reached $284 million, while Chinese
engine orders that year were valued at more than $1 billion (list
price) (“GE Jet Engine Backlog Climbs to $5 Billion in China,” 2008).
In 2008, GE Aviation’s direct sourcing in China totaled $365 million
(“GE Aviation’s Presence in China Continues to Grow,” 2008).<br><br>
In fall 2009, GE Aviation concluded a number of MOUs with
AVIC, establishing three joint ventures in connection with GE’s bid on
the COMAC C919 program. These included a venture to supply engine
nacelles and components (“AVIC Aircraft and Nexcelle Announce
Plans for a Nacelle Joint Venture in China,” 2009), a venture to supply
integrated avionics systems (“GE and AVIC Joint Venture Creates
New Global Business Opportunities,” 2009), and a final assembly line
for the CFM LEAP-X1C engines (“CFM and ACAE Sign MOU for
LEAP-X1C Assembly Line In China,” 2009). GE was subsequently
awarded the contracts for the propulsion system, engine nacelles, and
avionics-core processing system of the C919 (“CFM Picked to Power
China’s Future Plane,” 2010).<br><br>
Goodrich Corporation<br><br>
Goodrich launched its first facility in China in 1996, a joint-venture
MRO facility with Xiamen TAECO to service engine and flightcontrol
systems, actuation systems, and various other aviation systems
and equipment. In June 2009, the company opened another facility
in Tianjin to provide nacelle and thrust-reverser MRO services and to
support engine buildup and podding work for the new Airbus A320
assembly line in the same city. Later that year, Goodrich signed an agreement with XAIC to form two joint ventures to produce landinggear
and engine-nacelle components (“2009 Press Releases”).<br><br>
Since 2003, Goodrich has procured CF34 fan cowls from
the Boeing Tianjin Composites Co. In 2008, it contracted with
Hongdu Aviation in Nanchang to build parts kits for the 787 nacelle
(Butterworth-Hayes, 2010, p. 27).<br><br>
Hamilton Sundstrand<br><br>
Hamilton Sundstrand launched its first production facility in China
in 1994, establishing a joint venture in Shenzhen to produce rotaryscrew
air compressors. In 2000, it established an additional joint venture
in Xiamen to provide MRO services to Chinese airlines. The
Hamilton-Sundstrand Industrial (Shanghai) Co., a wholly owned
subsidiary, manufactures a range of Milton Roy metering pumps and
employs more than 130 workers. Most recently, Hamilton Sundstrand
announced a new joint venture with AVIC Systems Co. in April 2010
to supply the electrical system for the COMAC C919 program (“China
Locations”).<br><br>
Honeywell International<br><br>
Honeywell International has an extensive presence in China, with
about $600 million in total investments and more than 9,000 employees
spread across more than 30 subsidiaries and local joint-venture
companies. Honeywell’s Aerospace division supplies key components
to several major Chinese aviation programs, including the APU systems
for the MA60, the propulsion system for the Z-11, integrated avionics
for the Y-12, and various components for the ARJ21 (Liu, 2009,
p. 61).<br><br>
Honeywell Aerospace operates three joint-venture companies
and one wholly owned subsidiary in China. These include a jointventure
MRO facility in Shanghai to service wheels and brakes,
a joint-venture facility in Xiamen to service APUs and other avionics
equipment, a joint venture in Shanghai to produce environmental-
control systems, and a wholly owned subsidiary (the Honeywell
Aerospace Engine (Suzhou) Co.) to produce cabin-management
systems and engine parts mainly for re-export back to the United States. In November 2008, Honeywell selected HAIG as subcontractor
for the HTF7000 engine nacelles used on Embraer business jets
(“Honeywell China―Aerospace”). More recently, in July 2010, Honeywell
reached an agreement with AVIC subsidiary FACRI to form a
50-50 joint venture to supply the flight-control system for the COMAC
C919 (“Honeywell Selected to Provide Flight Control Fly-by-Wire
System for COMAC’s C919 Airliner”).<br><br>
Parker Hannifan<br><br>
Parker Hannifan was one of the first foreign companies to establish a
joint venture in China in the early 1980s. The company currently maintains
several regional offices and 11 manufacturing facilities (including
at least five joint ventures) in China, employing more than 3,000
employees (“Parker China,” 2009). In April 2010, Parker announced
a joint venture with AVIC Systems to supply the fuel and hydraulic
systems for the COMAC C919 (“Parker Aerospace, COMAC, and
AVIC Systems Hold Contract Signing Ceremony for Fuel, Inerting,
and Hydraulic Systems on New C919 Aircraft”). Parker also procures
machined components from the Jincheng Corp., the Shanghai
Qi Yi Automotive Company, and Sichuan Golden Dragon Machines
(Butterworth-Hayes, 2010, p. 27).<br><br>

Pratt & Whitney<br><br>
As noted earlier, Pratt & Whitney operates joint-venture production
facilities in Chengdu, Xi’an, and Zhuzhou that supply various components
for its commercial aircraft engines and industrial gas turbines.<br><br>
Primus International
Primus International operates a production facility in Suzhou for aircraft
components (Butterworth-Hayes, 2010, p. 27).<br><br>
Rockwell Collins<br><br>
Although Rockwell Collins has supplied the Chinese market for more
than 25 years and has provided a range of avionics equipment for Chinese
aircraft, including the ARJ21, MA60, Y-8, Y-12, and K-8 military trainer, the company did not own any production facilities in China as
of September 2010. In connection with its bids on the COMAC C919
project, however, Rockwell Collins concluded two joint-venture agreements
with Chinese companies in 2010 to supply the C919’s communication
and navigation systems and integrated flight-data surveillance
system (“Rockwell Collins to Provide Integrated Surveillance System
for COMAC C919,” 2010). These new ventures will be based in China.<br><br>
In addition, Rockwell Collins won the bid for the C919’s cabin-core
system and will collaborate with SAMRI in this effort (“Rockwell
Collins Selected to Provide Cabin Core System for COMAC C919,”
2010).<br><br>



Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation<br><br>
As of October 2010, Sikorsky had awarded subcontracts on its three
largest commercial helicopter programs to the Changhe Aircraft Industries
Corp. in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi. These include:<br><br>
 Tail-rotor pylon and horizontal stabilizer on the S-92, contracted
since 1995.<br><br>
 Airframe components and assemblies for the Schweizer 300C/
CBi light helicopter, contracted since October 2006 (“Schweizer
Selects Jiangxi Changhe Aircraft to Provide 300CBi Helicopter
Airframes,” 2006).<br><br>



 Airframe components for the S-76C++ medium helicopters, contracted
since July 2007 (“Sikorsky Aircraft Selects Changhe to
Supply S-76 Helicopter Airframes,” 2007).<br><br>
Smiths Aerospace (GE Aviation subsidiary)<br><br>
Smiths Aerospace operates a production facility in Suzhou to supply
engine parts and flight-control components (“Smiths Opens Aerospace
Components Facility in Suzhou,” 2004).<br><br>
Spirit Aerospace<br><br>
Spirit Aerospace procures Section 48 for Boeing 737s from Shenyang
Aircraft Industrial Co. <br><br>





The Timken Company<br><br>
The Timken Company operates an aerospace precision-products manufacturing
center in Chengdu, established in 2006. The facility employs
200 workers and manufactures ball and cylindrical roller bearings up
to 12 inches in diameter (“Timken to Launch Aerospace Manufacturing
in China,” 2006). The company also designed a custom bearing
solution for AVIC’s MA-60 turboprop liner. Timken has nearly 4,000
employees in China, spread across various large-scale manufacturing
facilities serving primarily the automotive and power-generation industries
(“MA-60 Aircraft Land on Custom Timken Bearings,” 2008).<br><br>
Vought<br><br>
Vought procures 737 overwing exits and forward entry doors and 747-8
horizontal-stabilizer parts and subassemblies from Chengdu Commercial
Aircraft Co.<br><br>










Non-U.S. Companies<br><br>
Airbus SAS<br><br>
Airbus’s subcontracting relationship with China began in 1985, soon
after Airbus concluded its first sale in China―a contract for five Airbus
A310s with the predecessor of today’s China Eastern Airlines. Airbus’s
first Chinese subcontractor was XAC, which supplied electronic bay
doors for the A300/310 family of aircraft (“Industrial Cooperation and
Technology Transfers”; “Airbus in China”).<br><br>
Airbus’s presence in China has expanded rapidly in recent years.
Following a December 2005 Chinese order for 150 A320 aircraft,
Airbus procurement in China has increased by an average of some 42.5
percent per year; the company’s annual procurement from China is
expected to reach $200 million in 2010, nearly six times the 2005 level.<br><br>
(For unknown reasons, the English version of the company’s summary
of its China presence gives the 2010 procurement figure as $120 million.)
It is said that more than half of the Airbus fleet in service worldwide
today contains Chinese components. Airbus also launched three
joint ventures with Chinese aviation-industry partners, including a
complete final assembly line for the A320 family of aircraft established
in Tianjin in 2008 and a composite manufacturing center in Harbin. <br><br>

According to some reports, annual procurement is projected to reach
$450 million by 2015 (“New Airbus’ Logistics Hub in Tianjin to Serve
All Projects,” 2009).<br><br>
Airbus’s subcontracting relationships in China are summarized
in Table 4.4.<br><br>

<a href= "pic36.html">Table 4.4 Current Airbus Work Packages and Procurement at Chinese-Owned Enterprises</a><br><br>

Bombardier Aerospace (Canada)<br><br>
According to Bombardier statements, some components of Bombardier
aircraft have been manufactured in China by subcontractors for more
than 25 years (“Bombardier in China: Local Partners and Suppliers”).
In recent years, Bombardier Aerospace has signed several additional
subcontracting agreements with Chinese manufacturers for its Dash-8
Q400 and C-Series aircraft (“Bombardier in China: Local Partners
and Suppliers”).<br><br>
Shenyang Aircraft Corp. (SAC) is Bombardier’s major subcontractor
in China. The contracts include the following:<br><br>
 Major components, including the empennage and aft and forward
fuselage sections on the Dash-8 Q400, amounting to 12
percent of the aircraft by weight, contracted since 2006.<br><br>
 Fuselage, center wing box, and doors on the C-series regional jet,
amounting to more than 10 percent of the work packages, contracted
since 2008. According to Bombardier statements, the contract
gave SAC design authority on major supplied parts, the first
contract of this kind with a Chinese subcontractor in the industry.<br><br>
SAC is to be a risk-sharing partner in the design and manufacture
of the contracted parts (Butterworth-Hayes, 2010, p. 27).<br><br>
Fischer Advanced Composite Components (FACC)<br><br>
FACC, acquired by XAIC in December 2009, procures interior composite
panels from Boeing Tianjin Composites Co. (“Xi’an Aircraft
Acquires Austrian Company FACC,” 2009).<br><br>

Fokker Aerostructures (The Netherlands)<br><br>
Since 2005, Fokker Aerostructures has procured components for the
Gulfstream G450, G500, and G550 business jets from Shenyang Aircraft
Co. (“Shenyang Aircraft Corporation and Fokker Aerospace
Group to Work Together in Machining for Gulfstream Aircraft Components,”
2005).<br><br>
Fokker-Elmo (The Netherlands)<br><br>
Fokker-Elmo operates a facility in Langfang, Hebei Province, to supply
99 different parts to the Boeing 737 program and 142 to the Boeing
777 program (Butterworth-Hayes, 2010, p. 27).<br><br>
Korean Aerospace Industries (Korea)<br><br>
Korean Aerospace Industries procures parts for the vertical fin and the
horizontal stabilizers on the 737 from Shanghai Aircraft Industries
Corporation, Xi’an Aircraft Company, and Boeing Tianjin Composites
Corporation.<br><br>
Messier-Dowty (Safran subsidiary in France)<br><br>
Since 2002, Messier-Dowty has had a production facility in Suzhou
that supplies medium landing-gear structural components to Boeing
(including for the 787), Airbus (in particular, for the A320), Bombardier,
Dassault, and Hawker Beechcraft (“Operations―Suzhou”).<br><br>
Rolls-Royce (U.K.)<br><br>
Rolls-Royce’s joint-venture production facilities at Xi’an supply turbinenozzle
guide vanes and low-pressure turbine blades for Rolls-Royce
engines. Several Chinese-owned enterprises are also important suppliers
to Rolls-Royce: Sichuan Chengfa Aero Science and Technology
supplies rings, sheet metal, and fabrications; Beijing Aero Lever Precision
supplies variable stator vane levers; Shenyang Liming Aero-Engine
Group Corp. produces heat-shield rings for the BR700 series engines;
and Xi’an Aero Engines Co. supplies other unspecified components. In
July 2010, Rolls-Royce reportedly invested RMB4.3 billion to establish
a new production plant in Shenyang to supply key components,
including stub axles and engine valves for the company’s new Trent XWB engine (“Rolls-Royce: Procurement in China to Increase Threeto
Four-fold over the Next Five-to-Eight Years,” 2010).<br><br>
According to company executives, Rolls-Royce expects to expand
procurement in China three- to four-fold over the next five to eight
years, reaching approximately $1.2 billion annually from a current
level of $250 million (“Rolls-Royce: Procurement in China to Increase
Three- to Four-fold over the Next Five-to-Eight Years,” 2010).<br><br>
Safran-Aviation<br><br>
The Safran Group’s industrial cooperation with China dates back to
the early 1980s, when Safran’s predecessor, Sagem, transferred autopilot
technology to AVIC’s Lanzhou plant for the Z-9 helicopter. Smallscale
local production of aerospace-engine parts began in 1990 (“Safran
History in China”). In 2002, Safran component Messier-Dowty established
a wholly owned manufacturing plant in Suzhou, initially specializing
in medium structural components for Messier-Dowty’s business
and regional jet programs. Since then, production has expanded to
include work share on the A320 and the 787 (“Operations―Suzhou”).<br><br>
In late 2005, Safran component Snecma established a wholly owned
production facility in Suzhou. The facility specializes in the production
of turbine and compressor shafts, LP turbine guide vanes (second stage)
and LP turbine rings (first stage), as well as the assembly of Module 13
for the CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B engines (“Worldwide―Snecma
Suzhou”). In 2008, the Messier-Dowty and the Snecma plants both
moved into a new shared facility in Suzhou.<br><br>
Other Sources of Western Aerospace Technology<br><br>
In December 2009, AVIC subsidiary XAIC acquired a 91.25-percent
share of FACC, for an undisclosed amount. FACC supplies the interior
cabin components for the COMAC ARJ-21 and C919 airliners. This
was the largest acquisition by a Chinese enterprise in central Europe
and reportedly also the first Chinese acquisition of a European aerospace
manufacturer. Xi’an plans to establish a composite-materials
R&D center built around Fischer in Europe, while setting up production facilities in China to take advantage of China’s low labor costs
(“Xi’an Aircraft Acquires Austrian Company FACC,” 2009, p. 10).<br><br>
Xi’an will reportedly inject at least 40 million ($58 million) in
fresh equity into FACC. Prior to the acquisition, FACC almost doubled
its net loss, to 19.6 million, in fiscal year 2008C2009 (“China’s
XAC Buys Plane Parts Maker FACC,” 2009).<br><br>
There is also at least one instance of a Western aerospace company
acquiring partial ownership of a company in China’s aerospace sector:
EADS holds a 5-percent stake in AviChina, a Hong KongClisted subsidiary
of AVIC engaged in the international marketing of AVIC helicopters,
trainers, and other light aircraft. However, this appears to be
primarily a joint-venture marketing effort rather than a true crossholding
relationship between AVIC and EADS. Currently, no other
Western aerospace company appears to have acquired ownership stakes
in any Chinese aerospace company, but the Chinese government has
been pushing to increase the number of publicly listed aerospace companies
in China, and such relationships may increase in the future. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">Chapter Six Conclusions</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
China’s aerospace sector has advanced at a rapid, though not unanticipated,
rate over the past decade and will continue to advance in future
years. At present, however, it still lags behind the state of the art in
virtually all areas. Nonetheless, the development of China’s civil aerospace
sector is unquestionably contributing to the development of its
military aerospace capabilities, increasing China’s ability and possibly
its propensity to use force in ways that negatively affect U.S. interests
and would increase the costs of resisting attempts to use such force.<br><br>
The Rate at Which China’s Aerospace Sector Has
Developed
Until the creation of COMAC in 2008, all of China’s civilian and military
aerospace products were produced by China’s state-owned defense
conglomerates. Even as China’s economy was opened up, beginning
in the 1970s, these industries remained backward and inefficient,
burdened by remaining part of the planned economy and starved for
resources. A 2001 RAND study (Cliff, 2001, pp. 24C25), noted
The combat aircraft [produced in China] are mostly based
on 1950s and 1960s Soviet technology . . . and other than
co-assembly of McDonnell Douglas passenger aircraft . . .
China’s capability for producing transport aircraft is limited to
short-range and medium-range turboprops. Chinese helicopters
in production are all based on European models. <br><br>

The same study noted that “China has an impressive [space]
launcher capability for a developing country” (emphasis added), but that
“China’s satellite capabilities are less impressive than its launch capabilities”
(Cliff, 2001, pp. 27C28).<br><br>
China’s military modernization drive since the late 1990s, however,
has resulted in important structural reforms and increased
resources for its aerospace industries, and China’s aviation sector has
become increasingly involved in supplying civilian aircraft components
to major foreign manufacturers.1 Progress has been rapid. China
is now able to produce modern military aircraft, highly reliable space
launch vehicles, a wide range of military and civilian satellites, and an
increasingly wide and sophisticated range of components for Western
airframe and engine manufactures such as Boeing, Airbus, Eurocopter,
Pratt & Whitney, GE, and Rolls-Royce.<br><br>
Nonetheless, important capability gaps remain. Many of the subsystems
on Chinese-built military and civilian aircraft, particularly
turbofan and turboprop engines, must still be imported. Despite ambitions
since the late 1990s to develop a domestically designed regional
or large airliner, China does not have such an aircraft in operation.<br><br>
And while a regional jet, the ARJ21, is now in testing, it uses foreign
engines and avionics, the wing was designed with Russian help, and
only a small fraction of the aircraft was constructed from composite
materials; thus, even before it reaches production, whether it can compete
with existing Embraer or Bombardier regional jets is questionable.<br><br>
Similarly, while China has initiated efforts to develop a large commercial
aircraft, the C919, actual production is still years away. And even
then, all of the major subsystems, such as the engines and avionics, are
likely to be foreign-designed. China has not demonstrated the ability
to independently design and produce innovative and commercially
competitive aerospace systems.<br><br>
Relatively few studies of China’s aerospace industry as a whole
have been published in the past decade, but the rate of progress noted
above has generally been consistent with past assessments. The 2001 RAND study stated that “China can expect to make significant technological
progress in coming years but cannot possibly catch up to,
much less ‘leapfrog,’ the United States or Japan [in commercial technology]
in the foreseeable future” (Cliff, 2001, p. 58). Similarly, a 2005
RAND study that examined only China’s military aviation capabilities
(Medeiros et al., 2005, p. 201) noted that
Progress in China’s military-aviation industry is mixed and limitations
persist. There remain important gaps in China’s militaryaviation
R&D and production capabilities that will not soon be
filled. . . . Any programs under way to fill these gaps are only in
their very formative stages.<br><br>
The study concluded (p. 203) that
The technological gap between China’s military-aviation industry
and that of the most advanced countries will likely continue to
close in coming years, [but] China will certainly continue to lag
behind these countries.<br><br>
Thus, China’s aerospace manufacturing capabilities in 2011
appear to be largely consistent with what would be expected based on
the 2001 and 2005 RAND assessments.<br><br>
Future Developments<br><br>
It seems likely that over the coming decade China will begin producing
both a regional jet and a jetliner (the former being more certain
than the latter). Whether these aircraft will be competitive outside of
China, however, is less clear. Less of the ARJ21 will be made of composite
materials than current Bombardier and Embraer aircraft, meaning
that it will be heavier. In a market in which fuel efficiency is a key
characteristic, it is not clear why airlines would choose to forgo brands
with proven safety and reliability records to purchase an unproven and
less-efficient aircraft. Nonetheless, it appears that China’s domestic
airlines, encouraged by high tariffs for foreign-designed regional jets and possibly more direct pressure from the Chinese government, will
purchase a certain number of ARJ21s, and some state-owned carriers
in Third World countries may also purchase the ARJ21 in return for
diplomatic or other considerations. Thus, COMAC may wind up selling
enough ARJ21s to, if not actually turn a profit, at least justify the
investment in a learning process that will enable its next generation of
regional jets to be commercially competitive outside of China. Within
China, however, given the tariffs on foreign-designed regional jets and
the relatively small size of the Chinese regional jet market, the ARJ21
is likely to dominate.<br><br>
The story for the C919 is similar. The precise design of the aircraft
has not yet been finalized, so how advanced it will be is unclear.
However, its announced weight relative to its length and capacity suggests
a design no more advanced than that of the 1980s-era A320.<br><br>
Moreover, initial deliveries are not expected before 2016, and Boeing
and Airbus could easily develop and bring to market a more advanced
narrow-body jetliner by then if the C919 appeared to threaten their
market shares. Bombardier and Embraer are eyeing the narrow-body
market as well, as are Russian and Japanese aviation manufacturers,
so the narrow-body jetliner market in the coming decade is likely to
be extremely competitive. Thus, the commercial success of the C919
is far from assured, even though China undoubtedly has the capability
to manufacture an aircraft in this class. As with the ARJ21, China’s
domestic airlines will purchase a certain number of airframes but,
unlike the case of the ARJ21, the majority of narrow-body jetliners sold
in China could well be foreign-made, even after the C919 comes to
market. And until China develops a wide-body jetliner, all such jetliners
sold in China will be foreign-made. Again, as with the ARJ21, however,
the C919 program may ultimately be valued not for the profits it
produces but for the learning experience it provides, enabling China
to acquire the skills needed to develop a commercially competitive aircraft
in the future.<br><br>
The helicopters China produces under license from or has codeveloped
with Eurocopter are unlikely to generate significant export
sales, as each type also has production lines in France. However, the
existence of domestic production capabilities for a growing range of helicopters may mean diminished sales in China for non-Chinese helicopter
manufacturers. The huge potential demand for helicopters in
the country, moreover, may mean that additional types will be developed
over the coming decade, possibly purely domestic designs.<br><br>
China’s fixed-wing general aviation manufacturing capabilities
seem unlikely to develop rapidly in the near future. Current production
capabilities are extremely limited, and the lack of a significant
domestic market for fixed-wing general aviation has resulted in little
immediate incentive to expand these capabilities. As of 2006, Dassault
Falcon Jet Corporation expected China to acquire 300 new business
jets by 2015 (Sun, 2006), but China does not currently produce any
business jets, and none are under development.<br><br>
If the development of the CZ-5 series of launch vehicles is successful,
China’s space launch capabilities will improve significantly in
the future. The CZ-5 series will roughly triple China’s lift capacity to
both LEO and GEO. Also, a new generation of lighter launch vehicles,
the CZ-6 and CZ-7 series, is under development and should increase
the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of China’s space launch capabilities
(Perrett, 2010d, pp. 22C23). The reliability problems that plagued
China’s space launch vehicles in the 1990s seem to have been resolved,
so the primary limitation on China’s competitiveness in the commercial
space launch market today is U.S. export restrictions. The effect of
these restrictions is likely to erode in coming years, however, as non-
U.S. satellite companies develop an increasing range of satellites without
U.S. technology content.<br><br>
Near-term prospects for China’s satellite capabilities are less
promising, given the problems that have plagued the DFH-4 platform.<br><br>
However, there is no reason to believe that these problems will not
be resolved in the next few years, providing China with the basis for
an improved military satellite-communications capability, as well as
increasingly competitive commercial communications satellites. China’s
surveillance- and reconnaissance-satellite capabilities can probably
already satisfy the majority of military requirements and will undoubtedly
improve further over the next decade, with greater resolution and
the possible deployment of an X-band ocean-surveillance radar satellite.<br><br>
As these capabilities improve, China may acquire the option to enter the commercial satellite imagery market without compromising
its military imagery satellite capabilities. China’s Compass PNT satellite
system seems to be on schedule and, if so, will provide worldwide
coverage by 2020. This will provide China with an alternative
to relying on the U.S. GPS and Russian Glonass system for military
purposes. Whether there will be a revenue-generating commercial
market for the Compass system, given the availability of the free public
GPS system, however, is questionable. Finally, China will continue to
develop and deploy improved weather satellites in future years. Thus,
by 2020, China will likely have a fully deployed PNT system, highcapacity
civil and military communications satellites, high-resolution
surveillance and reconnaissance satellites, and highly capable weather
satellites.<br><br>
Potential to Contribute to China’s Military Capabilities
Military and civilian aerospace technologies do not overlap in all areas.<br><br>
Many military-specific aerospace technologies, such as low-observable
technology, low-bypass afterburning turbofan engines, electronic
countermeasures, and signals-intelligence satellites, do not have civilian
counterparts. Similarly, many civilian aerospace technologies do
not have military applications. Nonetheless, there are areas of overlap,
including computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing
technologies, precision machining, composite materials, high-bypass
turbofan engines, flight-control systems, space launch vehicles, communications
satellites, and imagery satellites. Thus, foreign involvement
in China’s civil aerospace sector unquestionably has the potential
to contribute to the development of China’s military capabilities.<br><br>
Even the manufacturing of components for Western aircraft and
engines probably provides some contribution to the development of
China’s military capabilities, to the extent to which Chinese enterprises
also involved in military aviation production do so, even if no direct
technology transfers are involved. The mere act of machining parts to
the specifications of Western aerospace manufacturers provides training
that is potentially applicable to the machining of parts for military aircraft, especially if representatives of those Western manufacturers
are present onsite to provide training and guidance in quality control.<br><br>
And the revenues generated can be used to upgrade the facilities and
machine tools of both civilian and military production lines.
Joint ventures can enable the direct transfer of manufacturing
technology into China, as can the transfer of production licenses
(depending on the amount of technical assistance provided with the
transfer). Some platforms and technologies are inherently dual-use.<br><br>
The Eurocopter AS365N is a medium utility helicopter with numerous
civilian applications. The license-produced Chinese version (Z-9),
however, is used primarily by the Chinese military.<br><br>
When foreign companies cooperate with Chinese enterprises in
the development of new systems, the potential to contribute to the
development of China’s military capabilities is even greater. As noted in
Chapter Four, in 1997, Eurocopter received a contract to assist China
in developing a new 6-ton transport helicopter. No new transport helicopter
was developed as a result of that project, and it appears that
China instead applied the technology acquired to the Z-10 attack helicopter,
which is in the same weight class. Similarly, the knowledge
Chinese companies acquire through foreign assistance in the development
of the ARJ21 and C919 could in the future be applied to the
development of military airframes. Indeed, aside from acting as troop
transports or military cargo aircraft, the ARJ21 and C919 airframes
themselves have the potential to form the basis for a variety of specialmission
aircraft. Airborne early-warning aircraft have been built on
the Embraer ERJ-145 airframe; the U.S. Air Force Airborne Warning
and Control System (AWACS) aircraft and Joint Surveillance Target
Attack Radar System (J-STARS) are built on the Boeing 707 airframe;
and the U.S. Navy’s new P-8 maritime patrol aircraft is built on the
Boeing 737 airframe.<br><br>
Similar arguments apply in the space sector. The German company
Daimler-Benz was reportedly involved in the development of the
DFH-3 communications satellite platform (Cliff, 2001, p. 28), which
is the platform used by China’s two military communications satellites.
Similarly, collaboration with Brazil in the development of the CBERS satellites undoubtedly aided the development of China’s military
reconnaissance satellites.<br><br>
Implications for U.S. Security Interests
As noted earlier, there is no question that China’s growing civilian
aerospace capabilities are contributing to the development of its military
aerospace capabilities. Many aerospace systems are inherently
dual-use―for example, commercial airliners can be used as military
transports and as the basis for special-mission aircraft. High-bypass
turbofan engines used on airliners share components of low-bypass turbofan
engines used on high-performance aircraft (the General Electric
F101, originally developed for the B-1B supersonic bomber, became
the basis both for the F110 fighter engine used on the F-16 and for
the CFM56, the best-selling airliner engine of all time (“General Electric
F101,” 2010). Autonomous flight-control systems can improve the
safety and performance of passenger aircraft but can also be used on
military unmanned aerial vehicles. Space launch vehicles can be used
for either military or commercial launches, and many satellite types,
including communications, PNT, and weather satellites, have both
military and commercial applications.<br><br>
Many of the skills and technologies required to produce commercial
or dual-use aerospace products are also applicable to purely
military systems. These include computer-aided design and computeraided
manufacturing, precision machining, and composite-material
manufacturing.<br><br>
There is also no question that China’s growing aerospace capabilities
have implications for U.S. security interests. Beijing claims that the
autonomous island of Taiwan is part of its territory and reserves the
right to use force to bring about unification, but the United States has
declared that any threat to Taiwan’s independence would be a threat
to its own interests. Similarly, a Chinese attempt to assert control over
territory it claims in the East China Sea and South China Sea would
affect U.S. interests in the freedom of navigation and in the security of
U.S. allies who also claim some or all of those territories. Thus, China’s growing aerospace capabilities increase its ability and possibly its propensity
to use force in ways that negatively affect U.S. interests and
would increase the costs―human and material―of resisting attempts
to use such force.<br><br>
However, it is difficult to quantify the extent to which improvements
in China’s civilian aerospace capabilities in general, and international
cooperation in the civilian aerospace sector in particular, are
driving improvements in China’s military aerospace capabilities. China’s
defense spending has quintupled in real terms since 1995, a greater
than 12 percent annual growth rate. This means that vastly more
resources are now available for the development of aerospace and other
defense capabilities than were available just 15 years ago. Moreover,
China’s military aerospace industry has benefited from direct technical
assistance from Russian, Israeli, and other foreign firms and technical
experts. With China being one of the world’s largest trading nations,
China’s military aerospace industry can purchase state-of-the-art parts
and technologies from throughout the world. The industry also has the
ability to tap into expertise in firms outside of the aerospace sector and
in Chinese universities, which themselves are increasingly integrated
into the world scientific and engineering community. Finally, China is
engaged in large-scale espionage efforts to acquire key aerospace and
other military technologies.<br><br>
The technologies being transferred to Chinese firms are in most
instances not cutting-edge. Leading aerospace firms are generally
reluctant to share their best technologies, because those technologies
are the source of their competitive advantage. As an example, Rolls-
Royce is unwilling to share its technology for forging unitary turbine
rings (known as bladed-rings, or “blings”) with its own wholly owned
subsidiary in Indianapolis, preferring instead to keep this “crownjewel”
technology at its facility in the United Kingdom.2 Out-of-date
Western technologies, however, can still be new technologies to
China, which, for example, has yet to master the technology for turbofan
engines, which first entered production 50 years ago in the West
(Younossi et al., 2002, pp. 9C24). But the nature of the aerospace technologies being transferred to China and the range of alternative
technology sources available make the U.S. security policy implications
opaque. Since it is difficult to quantify the degree to which international
cooperation in civil aerospace is assisting the development
of military aerospace capabilities in China, whether even a complete
cutoff of such cooperation would substantially slow that development
is equally unclear. A complete cutoff, moreover, would be impractical.<br><br>
Russia in particular is unlikely to go along with a U.S.-organized ban
on cooperation in civil aerospace with China, and whether European
and other Asian countries would do so is also questionable. A U.S.-only
ban would likely slow the development of China’s military aerospace
capability by only a small amount while handing business opportunities
to European and Asian companies and aggravating relations with
Beijing. At a minimum, a smart U.S. policy would limit restrictions to
cooperation in technology areas that are not available from other countries
or in which other countries that also possess those technologies are
willing to coordinate with the United States in imposing restrictions.<br><br>
China’s emergence as an aerospace power is perhaps inevitable but
hardly an accomplished fact. It will be at least another decade before
China has reached today’s state of the art, and by then, the state of the
art will have moved further ahead in ways that are, by the nature of
technological discovery, fundamentally unknowable in advance. U.S.
and other Western companies are deeply involved in China’s aerospace
development, and although this is unquestionably contributing to the
development of China’s military aerospace capabilities―capabilities
that one day might be used against the United States―those companies
are reaping profits for their American shareholders and keeping
Americans employed, even as they transfer lower-value-added production
to China. They are also helping raise the standards of living of
some of the one-fifth of the world’s population that lives in China,
increasing their ability to buy American-made products. And war with
China may never come. The policy choices here are far from black-andwhite,
and it is unclear whether the United States could significantly
improve its security through alterations of its policy toward civil aerospace
cooperation with China without having a significant negative
effect on U.S. economic interests. <br><br>
