Remarks by Prime Minister of Japan, Hon. Mr. Shinzo Abe<br><br>
Accepting Hudson Institute's 2013 Herman Kahn Award, Wednesday, September 25, 2013, The Pierre Hotel, New York City<br><br>
Thank you, Scooter. Ken, my friends, Chairman Stern, I am flattered. Thank you so much.<br><br>
President Reagan received this award. So did Vice President Cheney, Secretaries Kissinger and Shultz, and the list goes on, and on. And today, you have made me its first non-American awardee. I cannot thank you more.<br><br>
Herman Kahn predicted Japan's rise early in the 1960s. If he were still alive, and saw Japan today, what would he say? Would he say that the Japanese have again become like sunflowers, always looking toward the sun?<br><br>
I do hope so. Because by reinvigorating the Japanese economy, I am also hoping to bring back a sense of optimism for the future to the people of Japan. This is why we all rejoiced so much at the decision that the Olympics in 2020 should come to Tokyo.<br><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, a prolonged slump has downsized the Japanese economy. The amount lost is even bigger than the economy of Argentina.<br><br>
More and more young people were starting to give up hope. A majority of the Japanese had begun to expect that tomorrow they would be worse off than today.<br><br>
Were Japan a small country, it would not have mattered much. But it is not. The Japanese economy is still larger than Germany and the UK combined.<br><br>
In Japan, very few have served as Prime Minister twice. But the economic straits were so dire that the voters chose me once again.<br><br>


So, my first and foremost priority is to restore the economy.<br><br>
In order to drastically change the inward-looking mindset of the Japanese, and to encourage them to be bold, taking risks, my so-called first arrow called for a monetary policy untested until now.<br><br>
Second, to strike a right balance between fiscal consolidation and enhancing growth, my second arrow was about flexible fiscal policy.<br><br>
And the third arrow, which we are shooting now, wants you, Uncle Sam. Because it will make Japan more open to foreign investment.<br><br>
I now have to deliver, with your investment, with your expertise, and with your commitment to the future of Japan, a country that will be like a city, shining upon a hill, with free ports humming with commerce and creativity, .....to go on sounding Reaganesque.<br><br>
It is my belief that Japan and the U.S. together should lead the Indo-Pacific Century to make it one that cherishes freedom, democracy, human rights, and rules-based order, with the TPP as its backbone.<br><br>
That is why, I have decided that Japan must enter into the negotiations for the trade framework.<br><br>
And today, I am pleased to be telling you that my three arrows are bringing concrete results. Last year, in the third quarter, Japan's economy shrank by three point six per cent. But under my new policies, this year, in the first quarter, Japan's economy grew by four point one per cent. In the second quarter, three point eight per cent.<br><br>
Now, let me turn to the issues of national security.<br><br>
The question is this. Is Japan up to its task in this world where threats see no borders?<br><br>
Let me give you a picture.<br><br>

First, at the site of a UN peace keeping operation. Japanese troops are operating alongside another military from a country X.<br><br>
Suddenly, the X force is under attack. They ask for help to the Japanese, stationed nearby.<br><br>
But, the Japanese troops cannot help. Because it is unconstitutional to do so under the current interpretation of the Japanese Constitution.<br><br>
Take another example, this one on the high seas.<br><br>
The US aegis ships are deployed around Japan in cooperation with Japanese aegis ships against a potential missile launch.
They are concentrating their capabilities on the missile defense, leaving themselves weaker to air-to-sea attacks.
Now, all of a sudden, one of the US ships is attacked by an airplane.<br><br>
Again, the Japanese ships, no matter how capable, cannot help the US ship. Because to do so will constitute an act of collective defense, which is unconstitutional under the current interpretation of the Japanese Constitution.<br><br>
Those are the questions, we are seriously considering how to address.<br><br>
In this age, everything is connected. Nothing lies outside a network. Outer space has no borders. Chemical weapons transcend borders.<br><br>
My country cannot be the weak link in the chain.<br><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, I am working hard to rebuild Japan’s economy, while at the same time, working hard to reinvent our national security structure.<br><br>
For the first time ever, Japan will establish its National Security Council.<br><br>
For the first time ever, we will publish a national security strategy in which we will state what Japan is committed to, and what our aims are.<br><br>
Also, for the first time in eleven years, my government has increased its defense budget this year.<br><br>
By how much, you may want to know.<br><br>
Before that, we have an immediate neighbor whose military expenditure is at least twice as large as Japan’s and second only to the US defense budget.<br><br>
The country has increased its military expenditures, hardly transparent, by more than 10 per cent, annually, for more than 20 years since 1989.<br><br>
And then, my government has increased its defense budget only by zero point eight per cent.<br><br>
So call me, if you want, a right-wing militarist.<br><br>
Now to sum up, Japan should not be the weak link in the regional and global security framework where the U.S. plays a leading role.<br><br>
Japan is one of the world’s most mature democracies. Thus, we must be a net contributor to the provision of the world’s welfare and security.<br><br>
And we will. Japan will contribute to the peace and stability of the region and the world even more proactively than before.<br><br>
I am determined, ladies and gentlemen, to make my beloved country a “Proactive Contributor to Peace.” I am now aware, that my historical role should be to revitalize the nation and encourage the people to be more forthcoming, thereby leading them to become a proud bearer of the banner, the banner for a Proactive Contributor to Peace.<br><br>
I now know why you gave me this award. It is quintessentially Khanesque, isn't it, to encourage the receiver by predicting his future on his behalf.<br><br>
Thank you very much.<br><br>

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledges stronger security role for Japan<br><br>

Japanese prime minister points to increases in Chinese defence spending<br><br>
Friday, 27 September, 2013, <br><br>
Agence France-Presse in New York<br><br>


Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has vowed to keep boosting Japan's security role, saying that the officially pacifist nation should no longer be a "weak link" in the world.<br><br>

Visiting New York for the UN General Assembly, Abe signalled on Wednesday that he hoped to move ahead with "collective self-defence" that would allow Japan to assist its ally the United States.<br><br>

He also suggested that it was ironic that it was he who was dubbed a militarist in light of China's ballooning military spending.

"Japan should not be the weak link in the regional and global security framework where the US plays a leading role," Abe said at the Hudson Institute on the eve of his appearance at the UN General Assembly.<br><br>

"Japan is one of the world's most mature democracies. Thus, we must be a net contributor to the provision of the world's welfare and security," he said.<br><br>

"And we will. Japan will contribute to the peace and stability of the region and the world even more proactively than before."<br><br>

Japan's US-imposed post-second world war constitution stripped the nation of its right to wage war. Under the constitution's current interpretation, Tokyo cannot use force except in the narrowest definition of self-defence.<br><br>

In a scenario cited by Abe that sounded like a potential North Korean rocket launch, Japan would not be able to assist US ships near its waters if the vessels - not Japan itself - came under attack.<br><br>

Abe, a conservative who is in a stronger political position than any Japanese prime minister in nearly a decade, has long supported a more active security role.<br><br>

But any moves to inch away from Japan's steadfast pacifism could irk a coalition partner and anger neighbours China and South Korea.<br><br>

Abe defended himself with a biting reference to "an immediate neighbour" - clearly China - saying it had been increasing military spending by more than 10 per cent annually.<br><br>

"My government has increased its defence budget only by 0.8 per cent," Abe said.<br><br>

"So call me, if you want, a right-wing militarist," he said sarcastically.<br><br>













Shinzo Abe's new york speech Hudson Institute<br><br>

JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE TO RECEIVE HUDSON INSTITUTE'S 2013 HERMAN KAHN AWARD<br><br>

On Sept. 25, 2013, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will join an elite group of right-leaning leaders like Ronald Reagan, Henry Kissinger and Dick Cheney, as the recipient of an award from conservative Washington D.C.-based think tank, Hudson Institute.<br><br>

The award, named after Hudson Institute’s founder, the physicist-turned-geopolitical thinker Herman Kahn, is given every year to honor creative and visionary leaders with a Kahn-style dedication to national securityCtraditionally in the U.S. Mr. Abe will be the first non-American honoree to receive the Herman Kahn Award.<br><br>

“Abe is being honored as a transformative leader seeking to advance the kind of reform necessary to restore Japan to full economic vitality,” the institute said in its news release. At the award ceremony to be held in New York on Wednesday, Mr. Abe is expected to deliver “a major speech” on economic reform in Japan and the continuing importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance, according to the release.<br><br>

The Hudson InstituteCas well as Mr. KahnChas long had close ties with conservative leaders in Japan. Though Mr. Kahn started off his career as a physicist at the Rand Corporation in the 1940s, he moved on to writing about nuclear strategy with the publication of “On Thermonuclear War,” and then to the study of geopolitical trends, including the rise of Japan.<br><br>

Mr. Kahn is known for predicting Japan’s ascendance as early as 1962, and in 1970 wrote “The Emerging Japanese Superstate,” in which he said that the country would “almost inevitably” become a great economic, technological and financial powerCand would likely achieve global military and political clout as well. Mr. Kahn was a “confidante of every Japanese prime minister from Hayato Ikeda on,” until his death in 1983, the institute press release on the award to Mr. Abe said.<br><br>

Mr. Abe too “is a longtime friend of Hudson Institute, someone who knows the critical importance of ideas to effective governance,” Hudson Institute Chief Executive Kenneth Weinstein said, in the release. “Given Herman Kahn’s legacy of research on Japan, it is altogether appropriate to honor Abe-san.”<br><br>

Mr. Abe won’t be the first Japanese politician to speak at a Hudson Institute event, though. In December 2011, Nobuteru Ishihara, then secretary-general of Mr. Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party, also gave a speech, calling for swift nationalization of disputed islands in the East China Sea and deployment of Japanese troops there. The islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, have been a major source of diplomatic strain between the two countries.<br><br>

“The importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance is increasing as a means to deter any attempt by a country to forcefully change the national borders,” Mr. Ishihara was quoted as saying by the Japanese press at the time.<br><br>

Mr. Ishihara’s speech was quickly followed by one at the Heritage Foundation, another conservative U.S. think tank, given by his more famousCand controversialCfather, Shintaro Ishihara. At that April 2012 speech, the elder Ishihara, who was then governor of Tokyo, unveiled a plan for the Tokyo government to purchase the disputed islands. Japan’s national government headed off that purchase by nationalizing the islands itself later in the year, sparking massive anti-Japanese protests in China.<br><br>

Mr. Abe has made no secret of his own nationalist leanings. He’s pushing to strengthen Japan’s national security, as the nation feels growing pressure from China’s rising economicCand militaryCpower. China’s annual military spending has grown rapidly in recent years, reaching $166 billion in 2012, nearly triple Japan’s $59 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.<br><br>

But Mr. Abe needs to walk a fine line. He can’t pursue his pet issue of national security unless he first addresses Japan’s economic and fiscal problemsCmajor challenges on their own. Wednesday’s Hudson Institute speech will offer the latest clues on how Mr. Abe hopes to proceed.<br><br>
	
外交部回应安倍“叫我右翼军国主义者请便”言论 <br><br>
外交部网站 2013-09-27<br><br>

日本首相安倍晋三于当地时间25日下午在纽约发表演讲，称修改宪法解释以解禁集体自卫权的目的是使日本变成“为世界的和平与稳定更积极做出贡献的国家”。<br><br>

　　环球网报道 记者 关超  据日本共同社9月26日报道，日本首相安倍晋三于当地时间25日下午在纽约发表演讲，称修改宪法解释以解禁集体自卫权的目的是使日本变成“为世界的和平与稳定更积极做出贡献的国家”。他表示自己决心使日本成为“积极和平主义国家”。<br><br>

　　安倍在演讲中例举了与日本自卫队一同参与联合国维和行动的他国军队遭攻击以及与自卫队舰船一同航行的美国舰船遭攻击的情况。他指出：“他国的军队受到攻击，日本的部队也无法提供帮助。如果提供帮助，那就成了行使集体自卫权，依照现行宪法解释这是违宪的。”<br><br>

 
　　安倍表示：“如何处理这样的问题，我们正在认真研究。”他强调：“在美国承担主要作用的安全框架下，日本不能成为薄弱的一环。”他还表示：“赋予我的历史使命就是促使日本成为积极和平主义的自豪旗手。”针对有关日本“右倾化”的指责，安倍称：“如果大家想把我叫作右翼的军国主义者，那就请便吧。” <br><br>

安倍请便论系破罐子破摔式蛮横无畏<br><br>
2013-09-27   人民网<br><br>
危险的安倍式“请便吧”(钟声)<br><br>

　　安倍的蛮横与无畏有一个“成长”过程。有谁能保证，哪天条件成熟了，或是头脑热得过头了，今日的恣意妄言不会变成现实中的冒险？<br><br>

　　25日，日本首相安倍晋三在美国纽约一家智库发表演讲。信誓旦旦表白要带领日本成为“积极和平主义国家”的同时，安倍竟然声称“如果大家想把我叫作右翼的军国主义者，那就请便吧”。<br><br>

　　安倍哪来的底气给自己插上如此恶劣的政治标签？一个公然为军国主义侵略历史招魂、到处招惹事端的政客，何以能够将日本引向真正意义上的积极和平主义？<br><br>

-
　　仔细研读安倍演讲全文，不难看出，安倍在纽约所贩卖的，不过是拼凑价值观联盟的狂想、修改日本和平宪法的冲动、诋毁中国国际形象的险恶用心。如果说演讲传递出什么新的信息，那就是破罐子破摔的蛮横和挑战正义公理的无畏在升级。<br><br> 

　　安倍在演讲中放言要打造价值观联盟，同“盟主”一道领导即将到来的“印度洋―太平洋世纪”。安倍的自信缘自其“日本是最成熟的民主制国家之一”这样一个判断。如果颠覆历史事实、挑战战后国际秩序安排也能同“最成熟的民主制”兼容，这种“民主”究竟是什么货色？想高举价值观招牌引领未来，总得先成为一个为国际社会所接纳的“正常国家”吧。 <br><br>

　　修改和平宪法以解除束缚、改变日本在区域和全球安全框架下“薄弱一环”的角色。安倍再一次抒发了改变战后体制的强烈冲动。这种冲动究竟是要为“世界福利和安全”多作贡献，还是要干扰破坏“世界福利和安全”？ <br><br>

　　不妨听一听英国《金融时报》的评论：安倍政府“激怒邻国的挑衅言行和歪曲侵略历史的态度”， 将“对亚太地区和平与安全造成威胁”。 <br><br>

　　日本有识之士也清醒看到这种威胁。东京大学教授高桥哲哉指出，安倍对“战后历史的评价根据需要随时变化”，将这样的历史观和修宪、建立国防军、在海外开展军事行动等计划放在一起，“邻国显然会认为这是非常危险的动向”。 <br><br>

　　演讲中，安倍企图用日本防卫费仅是中国军费一半、防卫费增长率低于中国来渲染“中国威胁论”。何等荒诞的逻辑!如果仅仅根据军费多少来断定对世界的威胁程度，头把交椅岂非美国莫属？ <br><br>

　　中国坚持走和平发展道路，奉行防御性国防政策，战略意图是透明的，中国发展正常和正当的国防能力，不对任何国家构成威胁，日本无权对此说三道四。 <br><br>

　　“如果大家想把我叫作右翼的军国主义者，那就请便吧”，是安倍演讲中一句愤恨不平的反话。问题是，这句反话清清楚楚地表明，安倍浑然不觉“右翼的军国主义者”对自己来说是个敏感词汇。在他看来，抛出侵略定义未定论、放言修改“村山谈话”、靖国神社曲线拜鬼、不承认慰安妇问题是国家犯罪，乃天经地义之举，丝毫没有给他带来冲击“政治正确”的心虚与愧意。<br><br> 

　　需要看到，安倍的蛮横与无畏有一个“成长”过程。这种成长，有沿着错误方向滑落的加速度作用，有日本社会右倾化日益加剧的环境烘托，也同外部压力尚未达到令其立即收敛的程度有关。 <br><br>

　　言为心声，理念是行动的指南。有谁能保证，哪天条件成熟了，或是头脑热得过头了，安倍今日的恣意妄言不会变成现实中的冒险？<br><br> 

　　安倍式“请便吧”，再一次敲响警钟! <br><br>



The Hudson Institute is an American conservative[2][3] non-profit think tank based in Washington, D.C.. It was founded in 1961 in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, by futurist, military strategist, and systems theorist Herman Kahn and his colleagues at the RAND Corporation.<br><br>

The Institute is committed to innovative research and analysis that promotes ‘global security, prosperity and freedom’.[4] It promotes public policy change in accordance with its stated values of a "commitment to free markets and individual responsibility, confidence in the power of technology to assist progress, respect for the importance of culture and religion in human affairs, and determination to preserve America's national security."[5]<br><br>

The Capital Research Center, a conservative group that seeks to rank non-profits and documents their funding, allocates Hudson as a 7 on its ideological spectrum with 8 being "Free Market Right" and 1 "Radical Left".[6]<br><br>

In March 2011, Kenneth R. Weinstein was appointed president and CEO of the institute. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">“猎鹰”高超音速飞行器 </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2，HTV-2<br><br>


据德国《明镜》杂志网站报道，美国于2010年4月在太平洋上空试飞一种最新超音速无人驾驶战机，这种名为第二代“猎鹰”高超音速飞行器(Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2，HTV-2)的战机，可携带5吨重的物资，以超过音速5倍的速度在2小时内可抵达世界任何地方。<br><br>

　　HTV-2采用了Typ Minotaur IV发动机技术，将在加利福尼亚的范登堡空军基地升空试飞。在与火箭分离后，HTV-2将以高超音速度在大气层飞行，最后降落在太平洋中部夸贾林环礁的里根实验场。无人机将飞行8000公里，以检验飞机的绝热性和气体动力驾驶的稳定性。<br><br>

　　根据美国国防部下属的美国国防先期研究计划局(DARPA)的报告，HTV-2的载重量为5吨，是目前飞得最快的战机。这种黑色的楔型战机在2小时内可以飞行近1.7万公里，相当于地球周长的一半，而洲际导弹的射程只有5500公里至15000公里间。<br><br>

　　美军一直渴望有一种更快的高超音速战机，以取代正在超期服役的SR-71“黑鸟”超音速侦察机。这种侦察机的速度是音速的3倍，但是DARPA在技术上始终没有取得突破。<br><br>

　　2008年，DARPA提出了一项开发一种类似战斗机的HTV-3的计划。按照设计，这种飞机具有其它超音速飞机“无与伦比的性能”，速度可达到音速的6倍，将于2012年投入使用。然而由于2009年美国国会削减了财政预算，这个项目被迫搁浅，DARPA只好转为开发HTV-2。<br><br>

　　高超音速战机的开发给民用客机的发展带来希望。英国的工程师们正准备开发一种5个小时就可以从英国飞往澳大利亚的高速客机，这种飞机没有舷窗，设计容纳300名乘客，时速可达6000公里。(葛文元)<br><br>

Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) is a crewless,[1] experimental rocket glider developed as part of the DARPA Falcon Project capable of flying at 13,000 mph (21,000 km/h).[2] It is testing technologies to provide the United States with the capability to strike any target in the world within one hour.[3]<br><br>
The Falcon HTV-1 program, which preceded the Falcon HTV-2 program, was conducted in April, 2010. The mission ended within nine minutes from launch.[3] Both these missions are funded by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to help develop hypersonic technologies and to demonstrate its effectiveness.[4]<br><br>
Development of protection structures that are tough and light-weight, development of an aerodynamic shape that has a high lift to drag ratio, development of automatic navigation control systems etc. were some of the initial technical challenges that had been overcome in the final design.[4] The various departments involved in designing the vehicle included aerothermodynamics, materials science, hypersonic navigation, guidance and control systems, endo- and exo-atmospheric flight dynamics, telemetry and range safety analysis. The Sydney Morning Herald notes that when flying its fastest, the craft could cover 17,000 kilometres, the distance between London and Sydney, in 49 minutes.[3]<br><br>

The HTV-2's first flight was launched on 22 April 2010.[5] The HTV-2 glider was to fly 4,800 miles (7,700 km) across the Pacific to Kwajalein at Mach 20.[6] The HTV-2 was boosted by a Minotaur IV Lite rocket launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The flight plan called for the craft to separate from the launch vehicle, level out, and glide above the Pacific at Mach 20.[1][3] Contact had been lost with the vehicle nine minutes into the 30-minute mission.[3][7][8] In mid-November DARPA stated that the first test flight had ended when the computer autopilot had "commanded flight termination" after it had begun to roll violently.[9]<br><br>

A second flight was initially scheduled to be launched on August 10, 2011, but bad weather forced a delay.[10] The flight was launched the following day, on 11 August 2011. The unmanned Falcon HTV-2 successfully separated from the booster and entered the mission's glide phase, but again lost contact with control about nine minutes into its planned 30-minute Mach 20 glide flight. Initial reports indicated it purposely impacted the Pacific Ocean along its planned flight path as a safety precaution.<br><br>

Darpa does not plan to conduct a third flight test of the HTV-2. The decision was because substantial data was collected from the first two flights, and a third was not thought to provide any additional valuable data for the cost. The first flight provided data in aerodynamics and flight performance, while the second provided about structures and high-temperatures. Experience gained from the HTV-2 will be used to perfect hypersonic flight. Work on the HTV-2 will continue to summer 2014 to capture technology lessons and improve design tools and methods for high-temperature composite aeroshells.[14]<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">美海军X-47B无人机</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
X-47B是一架试验型无人战斗航空器（UCAV），由美国国防技术公司诺斯罗普・格鲁门公司开发。X-47项目开始于国防高等研究计划署的J-UCAS计划，现在已经是美国海军旨在发展舰载无人飞机的UCAS-D计划的一部分。X-47B于2011年首飞，并在2013年成功完成了一系列的地面及舰载测试。<br><br>
2013年5月14日，X-47B于布希号（CVN-77）成功进行起飞测试，并于一小时后降落马里兰州帕杜克森河海军航空站。<br><br>
X - 47B是人类历史上第一架无需人工干预、完全由电脑操纵的“无尾翼、喷气式无人驾驶飞机”，也是第一架能够从航空母舰上起飞并自行回落的隐形无人轰炸机。[2]<br><br>
X-47B于2011年2月4日在美国加利福尼亚州爱德华兹空军基地首飞成功。飞行测试共持续了29分钟左右，飞机最高爬升了1500米左右的高度。<br><br>
2013年5月14日，美国海军首次从“乔治・布什号”航空母舰上弹射起飞一架X－47B无人机并获得成功，X-47B无人机项目2007年启动，耗资14亿美元。2013年7月10日，一架X-47B型无人机降落在“乔治・布什”号航空母舰上。[3]<br><br>
X- 47B型无人驾驶飞机由美国诺思罗普・格鲁曼公司研制，设计时速可以达到800公里，最大飞行高度可达12000米。[4]<br><br>
X-47B无人驾驶飞机具备高度的空战系统，可以为美军执行全天候的作战任务提供作战支持。X-47B无人战斗机首次考虑应该具备良好的隐身性能和战场生存能力，再次考虑该型机将可以携带各种传感设备和内部武器装备载荷，可以满足联合作战网络作战的须求；然后该型机还应当能够进行空中加油，以提高战场覆盖能力和进行远程飞行。<br><br>
X-47B无人机的陆基检查、替代飞机飞行测试和实验室综合测试显示了新型飞机对引导员的巨大挑战。 X-47B无人机在测试中，推进声学和发动机启动顺序没有达到要求的性能水平，在进一步行动前，需要工程师进行故障检修，作出相关调整并增加实验室和飞机搭载测试。
诺斯罗普・格鲁曼公司已经开始制造X-47B型联合无人空战系统(J-UCAS)，该无人机是世界上首架陆基和航空母舰都能使用的无人驾驶侦察攻击机。<br><br>
外观<br><br>
X-47B外形与B-2型隐形轰炸机极其相似，被称为缩小版的B-2。尺寸直逼美海军现役的F/A-18E/F超级大黄蜂战斗机。<br><br>
载弹量<br><br>
X-47B两个内置弹舱各可以容纳一枚2000磅级的JDAM，其载弹量要远远超过现无人机。<br><br>

X-47B是无尾翼机，对所有波段的雷达波的隐身性能都极高。因为没有尾翼可以在着陆时采用大迎角便于减速，而且也不会影响到视野。<br><br>
油耗<br><br>
之前大多数长航时无人机都通过采用超大展弦比机翼来提高航程。这无论是从保证突X-47B8<br><br>
X-47B防性能来看，还是从航母甲板作业来看，都是不可取的。而X-47B采用了超高的内油系数，其最大起飞重量超过20吨，但其空重只有6吨多，省去了一切和人有关的重量开销。<br><br>
机身材料<br><br>
X-47B外翼由铝合金部件和碳纤维环氧复合材料蒙皮组成，其尺寸大约为16英尺×4英尺（4.88米×1.22米）。每个机翼装有副翼，并拥有高度集成的电子和液压管路。该机翼设计还包括机翼折叠能力，这样可以使飞机在母舰上占有更小的空间。该机翼是在田纳西州纳什维尔的GKN工程研发中心设计定型的，而生产则是在密苏里州的工厂完成的。<br><br>
作战能力<br><br>
X-47B飞行性能较高，作战半径长，可以在航母上自动起降，并有自主空中加油能力，再加上卓越的隐身性能，同美军各类现役战机相比，X-47B滞空时间更长，其800海里的作战半径，既可以使航母战斗群处于更安全的位置，也可以更深入内陆执行打击任务。另外，X-47B最大的优势在于隐身突防，它拥有非常优异的雷达和红外低可探测性，保证其能够突破敌方防空圈，为后续有人驾驶作战飞机打开通路。<br><br>
由美国诺斯罗普・格鲁曼（Northrop Grumman）公司研制的X-47B拥有蝙蝠型双翼与翼身融合的飞翼构型，其外形酷似前辈B-2隐形轰炸机，只是体积更为小巧。在为时29分钟的飞行测试中，携带激光制导炸弹的X-47B成功抵达1500多米的高空，最终平稳降落在飞行跑道上。<br><br>
X-47B工程历时三年，耗资6.36亿美元。爱德华兹空军基地将开展50余次试飞活动；与此同时，第二架X-47B的首飞亦在紧锣密鼓的筹划当中。诺斯罗普・格鲁曼公司日前宣布将于2013年进行X-47X-47B无人机<br><br>
X-47B无人机B的航母飞行测试。<br><br>
X-47B的问世标志着无人驾驶飞行器领域的革命性突破：它不仅是人类历史上第一架无需人工干预、完全由电脑操纵的“无尾翼、喷气式无人驾驶飞机”，也是第一架能够从航空母舰上起飞并自行回落的隐形轰炸机。<br><br>
迄今为止，所谓的无人机均无法完全脱离地面人员的控制。X-47B却可以利用计算机系统处理起飞、降落乃至空中加油等各项指令，亦可在无人干预的情况下自动执行预编程任务，以超过500英里（约合800公里）的时速在40000英尺（约合1.2万米）的高空飞行，在躲避雷达监测的同时向千里之外的目标发起攻击。因此，X-47B可大幅突破人类飞行员的身体承受极限，将美军飞行器的滞空时间从10小时提升至30小时左右。<br><br>






战略意义<br><br>
中程反舰导弹的发展将迫使美国的航母撤退到距离海岸足够远的地方运作。在这种情况下，载有飞行员的战机执行任务时必须依赖空中加油，从而增加了遭受打击的风险。<br><br>
X-47B的航程为2000海里，而且无人驾驶，能够为海军提供长程打击和完成侦察任务的能力。<br><br>
军事专家认为，这项发展在战略上具有重要意义，可以在美国重返太平洋的过程中增加美国海军的行动能力<br><br>
X-47B可以携带两枚精确制导导弹，在星期二的起飞试验中使用了与弹射载人战机相同的弹射装置。<br><br>

美国海军首架MQ8C无人直升机做好首飞准备2013-09-25 环球网 <br><br>  

据中国国防科技信息网报道，9月20日，诺格公司在美国文图拉郡海军基地进行了美国海军首架MQ-8C“火力侦察兵”无人直升机的最初地面静态测试和发动机试车，打开了飞机的动力系统，首次带动四个叶片转动。<br><br>
　　开展飞机的最初发动机试车有利于工程师收集数据，以保证在飞机首次试飞之前各系统的功能及相互间的通讯良好。诺格公司中距离战术系统副总裁乔治.瓦多来克表示，这些测试的完成意味着，已经为无人直升机的首飞做好了准备，我们将继续与海军客户紧密合作，以保证“火力侦察兵”系统顺利通过检测，为投入使用做好准备。<br><br>
　　最新升级到火力侦查系统的这种飞机将使海军的持久力提高到两倍，有效载荷搭载量提高到三倍，确保了最高级别的持续监视、情报及侦查的能力。诺格公司是海军火力侦查项目的主承包商，目前承担着从2014年开始的MQ-8C飞机制造合同。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">DDG-1000驱逐舰</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
DDG-1000驱逐舰是美国海军新一代驱逐舰舰，它体长183米，排水量为14500吨，拥有80个发射装置，可发射“战斧”式对陆攻击巡航导弹及其他类型的导弹。与“阿利・伯克”级导弹驱逐舰相比，DDG-1000的水面火力和反对舰导弹能力提高了3倍，雷达辐射面减少了50倍，防空能力提高了10倍，近海作战（包括扫雷能力）能力提高了10倍。<br><br>
美国最新研制的DDG1000驱逐舰几乎悄无声息，敌方雷达对其几乎无法察觉。它能从95英里外对一个目标同时发射6枚威力强大的导弹。它还是美国海军30年来首次推出的新型驱逐舰，其最大特点就是作战功能十分完备。该舰长600英尺，可游刃有余地在深海海域和波斯湾布满水雷的危险海域执行任务。[1]<br><br>
以前的大型战舰是为了在广阔海域进行对峙而设计的，并不能应对在海岸线区域出现的敌情。这些战舰不仅在地面雷达屏幕上显得十分庞大，而且缺少足够的传感系统，无法躲避敌方港口常常布设的水雷阵。<br><br>
DDG1000驱逐舰计划负责人吉姆・叙林上尉说，由于许多潜在冲突地区都靠近浅海海域，控制沿海地区显然很有必要。他说：“想象图  想象图[2]<br><br>
你得好好看看那些利益攸关的地区：波斯湾、日本海和朝鲜半岛。”<br><br>
无论是派遣海豹突击队，还是向内陆发射导弹，DDG1000驱逐舰都必须做到神不知鬼不觉。它行动起来悄无声息，那是因为1英寸厚的橡胶层――叙林将其比喻成大象的皮――消除了柴油发动机所发出的噪音。此外，它行动起来还神出鬼没。由于电子设备众多，当今战舰都是是各种天线林立，这样极易被动敌方雷达所察觉。因此，DDG1000驱逐舰的天线采用了考究的隐蔽式设计，在敌方的雷达上，该驱逐舰看上去就像一条渔船。<br><br>
DDG1000驱逐舰还具有很强的攻击能力。先进的舰炮可依靠卫星定位系统，在30分钟内发射600枚远程地面攻击炮弹。此外，该舰还拥有80个发射装置，可发射“战斧”式导弹及其他类型的导弹，更是令其如虎添翼。<br><br>
为了加强保护，DDG1000驱逐舰还安装了新型双波段雷达系统，可以搜索空中和海面的目标。这种雷达系统可对诸如艇上恐怖分子这样小的目标进行定位。另外，该舰还可精确探测水下雷区。<br><br>
美国海军和工业届已经签订了建造首批两艘DDG-1000的合同。两艘新舰代表了海军作战的转型的开始。 　<br><br>
首批两艘舰艇将分别在巴斯钢铁公司（通用动力公司下属公司）和英格尔斯公司（诺斯罗普・格鲁曼公司）建造。巴斯钢铁公司将建造DDG 1000，英格尔斯公司将建造DDG 1001。其他的主承包商还包括BAE系统公司和雷声公司。首舰预计将于2012年末到2013年初交付。<br><br>
DDG 1000驱逐舰是一级多功能水面舰艇，它将提供独立的前沿存在和威慑，并将作为海上和岸上联合和联盟部队的重要组成部分。DDG 1000舰的主要特点是联合火力支援，这使该舰能够在全天候的条件下对岸上的敌方目标进行精确打击和全方位开火。<br><br>
该级舰将装备先进的垂直发射系统，能够发射战斧巡航导弹。该级舰或进行独立部署，或作为航母战斗群或远征打击战斗群的一部分，将成为未来舰队的基础。海军部队的结构分析决定了美国海军可能建造7艘DDG 1000舰，来确保前沿存在和快速反应能力。<br><br>
DDG 1000也在实施区域空中监视能力方面进行了改进。雷达设备采用了S波段和X波段的双波段雷达。S波段立体搜索雷达将改进对濒海环境、近距离和远距离的隐身目标的探测能力。X波段多功能雷达将探测和支持捕获先进的反舰巡航导弹目标。<br><br>
该级舰的另一个特点是装备了先进舰炮系统（AGS），能够在支援岸上的联合作战部队时，进行史无前例的远程精确火力打击。AGS为6英寸，62倍口径的舰炮，能够发射远程对陆攻击弹丸（LRLAP）。7英尺长的LRLAP由GPS制导，火箭助推，射程可达83英里。由于装备了AGS和LRLAP，DDG1000舰能够为内陆的远征机动部队提供远程精确火力支援。LRLAP将扩大对内陆的火力支援区域。LRLAP的威力是常规的5英寸舰炮的三倍。另外，DDG1000还是一级采用全电力推进的舰艇。<br><br>
DDG1000和LCS近海战斗舰和新型的多功能CG(X)巡洋舰将未来美国海军水面的作战需求<br><br>
新型驱逐舰攻防兼备，其出众的攻击和防护能力令人刮目相看。该舰可向150千米外的一个目标，同时发射6枚威力强大的导弹。舰上的2座155mm舰炮可依靠全球定位系统，在30分钟内发射600发远程地面攻击炮弹。为了加强保护，DDG-1000驱逐舰还安装了新型双波段雷达系统，该雷达系统甚至可以对小艇上的恐怖分子进行定位。另外，该舰呈圆形的前端还安装了超级敏感的声纳组，可以精确探测水下雷区。<br><br>
雷达系统　据美国防务新闻网站2010年6月2日报道，美国国防部取消DDG 1000驱逐舰新型双波段雷达系统的一半以及首舰推迟交付服役一年的决定不象外界猜测的那样是由于成本增长或项目运行不善，相反，他们正在努力获得具有先进能力的新型雷达来装备DDG 1000舰，即空中导弹防御雷达（AMDR），该型雷达是一个目前处于早期开发阶段的系统，其设计源于应对弹道导弹防御，海军计划为新的DDG-51驱逐舰Flight III型安装该型雷达。<br><br>
将原计划安装在DDG 1000上的双波段雷达中移除SPY-4体搜索雷达（VSR）是由国防部负责采办的官员于宣布的。同时他还表示DDG 1000首舰的服役时间可能推迟。DDG 1000项目是成本严重超支或经历了重大调整的六个项目之一，需要国防部重新声明该项目对保证国家安全的重要性。<br><br>
根据国防部向国会提供的文件，双波段雷达的测试和开发仍在继续，没有解释移除VSR的合理性以及推迟首舰服役的原因。这一声明使海军和工业的官员都感到极为惊讶。2009年夏季，DDG 1000项目经理曾表示对双波段雷达开发较为满意。负责工程开发的Syring上校于2009年8月表示s波段和x波段都没有任何问题。<br><br>
双波段雷达的主承包商为雷声公司，该公司主要负责SPY-3 X波段多功能雷达，以及与洛克希德・马丁公司的SPY-4 S波段体搜索雷达相接合的控制器。双波段雷达还会按原计划安装在新型“福特”航母上。雷声公司，诺斯罗普・格鲁曼公司和洛克希德・马丁公司都将竞争AMDR项目。三家公司在4月都提交了招标申请书，海军正在考虑是选择一家或两家公司还是有三家公司共同完成。<br><br>
DDG-1000驱逐舰是一艘造价超过33亿美元的舰船<br><br>
这是电影《超级战舰》中各式战舰火力全开的场面，虽然过于科幻，但是美国海军现实版的超级战舰早已呼之欲出。<br><br>

　　据新加坡《联合早报》本月11日报道，美国巴斯钢铁厂正忙着为美国海军建造新一代大型隐形驱逐舰---“朱姆沃尔特”号驱逐舰，其工程之复杂和精密，堪称“工程界的新奇”。<br><br>

　　该舰将首次装上用于实战的电磁炮，将以往只在科幻小说、好莱坞大片中出现的秘密武器-电磁炮带进现实。<br><br>

　　美国海军上将乔纳森在参观“朱姆沃尔特”号时就表示，“超强的隐身能力，强大的声纳系统，猛烈的打击能力和较低的人员配备是未来我们打造战舰努力的方向。隐形的“朱姆沃尔特”号是迄今为止美国海军制造的最大驱逐舰，该舰的先进能力代表着美国海军的未来。”<br><br>

　　那么这艘超强战舰究竟有多大能耐？是否将成为美军未来王牌呢？《防务新观察》军事专家即将为您解析！<br><br>

　　演播室段落一<br><br>

　　主持人：为了今天的话题，我们的演播室请来了两位嘉宾，一位是本台的特约评论员国防大学的张召忠教授，一位是中国网络电视台的主持人曹煊一，她将带着网友的问题参与我们的讨论。<br><br>

　　说到朱姆沃尔特这个驱逐舰，美军的海军上将参观完之后，说它是美国海军的未来，它到底有什么特点，给它这么高的评价？<br><br>

　　张召忠：这艘舰的话，DDG-1000。这一级的话，它出来之后，那就是代表，真的代表美国海军的未来，你看那样子多漂亮，就一看以后让你感觉好像是，就是有网友讲星河舰队那种，你从来没有见过这样的。<br><br>

　　就是我看完以后，我就研究美国这么多年，我就感觉美国他这个舰艇设计，你看它搞舰艇，舰艇是一个杀人武器，是一个兵器，你看它设计得多富有艺术细胞。就他有那种想象力，这个舰艇给我最大的震撼，那种设计那种想象力多么丰富，很漂亮。<br><br>

　　主持人：但是中国有一句老话叫做有可能有些东西是银样蜡枪头，也就是说中看不中用，这个到底它有什么特点，在武器装备上？<br><br>

　　张召忠：美国现在开始犯以前的错误，美国在犯什么错误呢？都特别喜欢把一堆鸡蛋都放在一个篮子里，所有好东西都放在一个上头。<br><br>

　　就是这艘舰的话，将来有可能它会成为一个悲剧，就我们现在看到的好的东西特别多。比如说电磁炮，火箭助推的这种炮弹，还有隐身技术，舰艇的隐身技术，相控阵雷达，这种互联互通的CISR系统，就是所有这些好玩意，他全堆在DDG-1000上，这样最终有可能会导致这艘舰艇技术太高，远离美国海军的承受能力。<br><br>

　　就是说他最后搞得让你没有办法生产，美国历史上有很多这种科曼奇直升机，科曼奇直升机，把所有好的东西都放在一架直升机上，说有隐身，战斗力又强最后导致最后让拉姆斯菲尔德给砍掉了。这个东西将来我感觉它试验性的这种功能更多一点。<br><br>

　　曹煊一：说到朱姆沃尔特的特点，大家也是特别关注到了张教授刚才提到的一点，它这个身上有很多特别先进的装备，可能都要装备它的身上，尤其是说要首次装备这个电磁炮，因为电磁炮大家就很不陌生了，尤其是在《变形金刚2》当中，都见识过这个电磁炮的威力，电影当中也是从宙斯盾舰上发射，然后特别快速精准地就击中并且摧毁了金字塔顶的大力神。所以大家就特别关心说电磁炮的威力这么巨大，然后装备到朱姆沃尔特上，这是不是真的，是不是真的能有这么大的一个威力？<br><br>

　　张召忠：电磁炮这个事情80年代就开始研究了，预先研究，以后叫概念性研究，也叫新概念武器。那么这一艘舰的话，将来有可能会装电磁炮，但是这个朱姆沃尔特号，这个第一艘他装不了，现在他还没有实现，现在仅是试验，电磁炮弹大约是这么大小，不是说这么大炮弹。<br><br>

　　曹煊一：这个要装备舰上很难吗？<br><br>

　　张召忠：不是，他现在这个不成功，他装不了，现在装的这个炮，你看他画那个图不是电磁炮，电磁炮不是这样，它不是带炮管这样，从他画的这个图来讲，它还是一个155毫米的一个炮，是一个传统的炮，传统炮，但是发的炮弹，后边是带火箭助推的，可以打到预期，按现在的水平他能打到100公里，下一步能打到170公里200公里，这个并不是太高端的技术。<br><br>

　　主持人： 这个最大的特点还不是电磁炮，更大的特点是它？不仅它的体积上比伯克级的驱逐舰还大40%，而且排水量达到了1.5万吨级，这个对驱逐舰来讲，是相当大的个头。他居然号称能够隐身，他是怎么能做到？<br><br>

　　张召忠：隐身的东西，它现在是从，通过几种方式，就过去的隐身就是最早的隐身，80、90年代，就是外型设计的隐身。外型设计隐身就是你外表看起来之后，没有40度角以上的，就呈90度角这种直角的就没有，就这样就是，不成直角雷达波过来以后，它要反射回去才行，这样雷达波过去以后，一划就过去了，不形成反射，它不就发现不了吗，这是一个外型设计问题的。<br><br>

　　还有一个材料的问题，材料的问题就是，雷达波过来之后，它要把你雷达波吃掉，不形成反射，你像这个材料就可以了，入射的雷达波我要给你吸进去。就像比方说我们现在这个演播室，演播室周围全弄这么厚的海绵贴在一边，我们说话它就不可能形成这样的回响，这就是这个道理，我的声音过去以后都被吸掉了，都被吃掉了，这也是种隐身的办法。还有一种，雷达波过来之后通过这穿透走了，透波材料，雷达波过来以后，穿透我这个舰艇走了，这也是种办法。<br><br>

　　主持人：美国的驱逐舰其实不同的级别都一直是领先世界其他海军的，那么这一次他的这个舰和自己比，比如说和伯克级的比，它到底有哪些先进之处？<br><br>

　　张召忠：二战以后，驱逐舰它主要是分类的，防空的就是防空，反舰的就是反舰，反潜的就是反潜，所以一个驱逐舰一般的一个舰队里边配三类。到了提康德罗加和阿利伯克上边都是宙斯盾，宙斯盾系统。那么朱姆沃尔特跟它们相比，先进在哪几个地方？它们有的这些东西，朱姆沃尔特都有，就它们没有的，朱姆沃尔特跟它们相比，它们前面没有的，隐身，它们以前做不到，这个以前做不到。导弹，朱姆沃尔特在导弹的部署方面，它叫周边导弹垂直发射系统，这是个很新的创造，这个真的很先进。这个我想他借用了前苏联那个时候，他的潜艇的一些技术，奥斯卡级潜艇，奥斯卡级潜艇，你比方我们这个桌子这黑的这边就是奥斯卡级的耐压艇壳，这个就是海水，这个四中间，这是耐压艇壳到外边非耐压艇壳之间这中间放了一圈导弹，这个创意特别好，导弹放在耐压艇壳和非耐压艇壳之间，就它的压力都是一致的，压不坏它。你别人把导弹炸坏了，我这枚导弹不发射了，我另外一枚导弹是好的，你不可能同时把我所有的导弹都破坏了。<br><br>

　　曹煊一：那您说的是发射导弹这方面能力很强，那它导弹防御方面的能力吗？<br><br>

　　张召忠：导弹防御这个能力也非常强， 防空他现在利用了过去成功的系统，宙斯盾这个系统，相控阵雷达，伯克级的驱逐舰上边它有(向空阵)，是四个阵， 就是东西南北四个板阵，四个板阵，它都是实现360度覆盖，顶部无盲区，可以一个板阵可以同时发现400批目标，400枚以后，他眼神分不过来，计算机分析，400枚导弹，哪个先打给我，从中解算出100批来，霹雳啪啦，他调度他的100枚导弹去打，这个已经是够先进了，朱姆沃尔特比这个还先进。<br><br>

　　小片二<br><br>

　　朱姆沃尔特级隐形驱逐舰，被美国海军设计为多任务功能近海攻击舰与神盾防御舰。根据最新预算，该型驱逐舰每艘造价约38亿美元，如此巨大的成本使得其建造计划由最初设想的32艘锐减至三艘。首舰“朱姆沃尔特”号将于今年下水并于2014年交付海军，第三艘也是最后一艘朱姆沃尔特级驱逐舰也于本月宣布开始建造。美联社称，这是美国海军为了配合奥巴马重返亚太的军事战略，为制衡亚太而量身打造的“杀手锏”。那么美军重金打造的这艘“超级战舰”真的如此重要吗？随着新舰艇建造计划的展开，美国海军未来力量又将如何部署呢？《防务新观察》特邀军事专家，为您详细解析！<br><br>

　　演播室段落二<br><br>

　　主持人：美军未来的三至五年，要下这么大力气，投入这么大的财力，建造这个舰船，到底有多大的意义？<br><br>

　　张召忠：这艘舰的话可以肯定是个实验舰，这上边要试验的东西，他很重要的就是说他在研究一种办法，就是他要进入高威胁区，什么叫高威胁区，就是说他进入作战的这个海域，一定是敌方导弹能够打得到，潜艇能够够得着，岸基的飞机能够够得着，岸基的雷达能够发现，一定非常非常危险的这个区域，他要进来，而且让你发现不了。发现不了以后他要在这个地方发挥他的作用，发挥他的作用他要使用什么呢？一个使用导弹，导弹太贵，100万美元一枚，另外的话他要使用他的炮，他现在设计的炮要打170公里要打200公里，这就是他要试验这个炮，先从155毫米开始试验起，所以这都是体现了美国一种海军的一种新的思路。美国人的理念，所有的事情，我们理论上的争论归争论，但是必须要通过科学实验来积累数据。科学实验包括什么呢？建造一艘新舰或者是对我对一艘舰艇，各种武器对它进行攻击最后获得一种数据，要么就把它弄到战场上去。凡是没有经过试验的，没有经过战场上的考验的这些是不能够服役的。比基尼岛核试验的时候，一弄就是5、6艘航空母舰就放在比基尼岛然后看看，5公里、10公里、15公里、20公里，看看我这个核爆炸以后，哪些个舰艇被摧毁了，对不对？埃塞克斯号，这个列克星敦号最后就被摧毁了，但是独立号当时没有被摧毁，美国说研究研究，为什么有的被摧毁，有的没被摧毁？就是他有这种习惯。他现在朱姆沃尔特很明显，就是所有的高新技术都放在这儿，花30亿、50亿，我值，我这上面得到的技术，放在其它的大批量建造的舰艇上去这是一个试验田，这是一个实验田，如果这个实验田成功了，我推而广之，我的技术肯定比我的作战对手要先进20年到30年。
主持人：听着教授的观点，好像朱姆沃尔特号就是袁隆平搞的一个实验田，然后试验成功了再推而广之用到别的舰上去，好像造这么一个舰用了这么大的价钱而且几起几落，最终决定还是造，好像只是为了试验？<br><br>

　　张召忠：袁隆平一辈子不是光搞试验田的，他的目的是通过试验田试验出来之后，把那个种子给你弄到全国各地都推广，全世界都推广。朱姆沃尔特就是解决试验田的问题。那么他现在核心的主导的思想，通过这些试验田试验什么呢？试验美国过去自己不掌握的一些技术，美国公海大洋作战这么多年了，这一套它是轻车熟路，但是在近海沿岸，高威胁区作战我怎么去对付，我过去对付人家的航空母舰，那一套他轻车熟路，打日本，日本24艘航空母舰，都让美国一个一个都给敲掉了。但是我近海沿岸怎么对付这个小快艇，小导弹艇，小鱼雷艇，扫水雷，怎么在对方的雷达的监视下，岸基导弹，岸基飞机的监视下，我深入进去，他现在在摸索这一套东西。<br><br>

　　曹煊一：那这么看的话，朱姆沃尔特很厉害，那它难道就没有它的弱项吗？比如说关于建造朱姆沃尔特这个驱逐舰这个事，美军内部实际上它意见就是有争议的，比如说有人就拿它跟现在的驱逐舰比，就说它是有弱点的，比如说它在近海作战的时候，就更容易成为打击的目标，这是它的弱点吗？<br><br>

　　张召忠：对付这样的舰艇你一定要换个思路，就是不要用那种，这种常规的思路，就是说对付朱姆沃尔特这个舰，你就是发挥这种笨办法。我估计它从这来，我弄几十艘小渔船，晃悠晃悠，它就完了。我小渔船到那上边装一些炸药包，它就贴着，给你把炸药包给你吸附到上头去，到处炸得都是洞，你不就完了吗，它这个不行。<br><br>

　　曹煊一：所以他以后是不是也不会单独作战，它周边也会弄点保护它的？<br><br>

　　张召忠：你说反了，这个人谁要是给他护航，他嫌你烦，我是隐身的，你们这帮小子都不是隐身的你跟着我干啥，对不对？他肯定不要别人护航。<br><br>

　　小片三<br><br>

　　目前，美军针对亚太地区的军力强化部署主要是：60%的攻击型核潜艇将部署到亚太，14艘弹道导弹核潜艇中有8艘要放在亚太，此外11艘航母中有6艘都将相继部署在亚太地区。近期，美国海军还提交了2013财年的新版30年舰船建造计划，按照这一计划，虽然美军舰队规模和平均造船速度略有下降，但驱逐舰的建造速度却是在提升，并且像朱姆沃尔特级这类大型战舰的数量将增加16艘。那么美国海军将如何针对亚太打造最强战舰力量？美军重返亚太的步伐又是否会随之加快呢？《防务新观察》特邀军事专家，继续为您解析！<br><br>

　　演播室段落三<br><br>

　　主持人：从短片中我们看到了美国海军所提交的2013财年的未来30年的建造计划，到底他这里边有哪些玄机有哪些变化？我们也听一下我台驻美国的记者王冠发回来的报道。<br><br>

　　王冠：根据这个未来三十年造船计划我们可以看到，首先这次的新版造船计划涵盖的时间是从2013年到2042年这三十年，其中提出的2042年舰队的规模应该控制在298艘，而且根据这个计划未来十年美国海军将退役七艘宙斯盾巡洋舰，并且放缓弹道导弹驱逐舰的建造速度，而且他们这份计划还说要取消十余艘联合高速船的采购计划，但是像朱姆沃尔特这样大型的战舰的数量将增加十六艘，而且这份报告说小型水面战舰到2029年将只剩下濒海战斗舰，比原计划提前了六年。当然这只是目前五角大楼提出的一份2013财年的报告，需要得到美国国会也就是参议院和众议院的批准，这就是我们了解到的信息。央视记者王冠美国华盛顿报道。<br><br>

　　主持人：张教授刚才听了咱们台的记者发回来的报道，你有什么样的一些感受？<br><br>

　　张召忠：就美国舰艇的数量越来越少，但是质量越来越高，为什么呢？美国的质量都是通过提高技术来获得的。数量它很重要，到今天来讲这个数量已经不是求得质量的一个根本的途径而是保持基本的一个编制的一种方法。本来这个自动化以后对人员的编制就减少了很多，你这个舰艇的数量又减少了，那美国海军他全是靠舰艇来成编制的，你给他都缩减完了以后他没编制了，海军太糗了。<br><br>

　　主持人：但是他这个新的裁员计划所公布未来人员的发展，是不是也凸显了这样一条，他会不会经过这样的一个计划，会完成他的一些设想，重点发展一些我们今天讨论的那些全新的这些舰船？<br><br>

　　张召忠：美国他现在是，他有一个什么，很好的一种想法，就是和平时期，和平时期一定要大量的减少舰艇的数量，因为你造多了是浪费，他又不打仗。那我省下钱来是干什么呢？省下钱我去搞试验舰，像朱姆沃尔特，濒海战斗舰这些都是试验舰。把所有的高新技术弄到这上边来试验，这个舰严格来讲不是让它将来批量作战的，是让它试验出来的高新技术，推广到？他们研究这些东西，有可能会在几年之后，十几年之后会推广到一些大批量的舰艇建造的里头去。<br><br>

　　曹煊一：我看很多网友也特别关心美国的这些超级战舰的动向究竟怎么样？比如说有友就问，说，美国最新型的驱逐舰核潜艇濒海战斗舰目前都已经是到了最后的阶段，那么一旦服役的话，那么美国海军会如何部署这些战舰？<br><br>

　　张召忠：严格来讲，阿利・伯克和提康德罗加，斯普伦斯，尼米兹这些个舰艇，他设计的时候，他针对的作战对象是苏联，针对的是苏联，他是设想是在离岸1千公里，5千公里，公海大洋，这是苏联的航空母舰编队，这是美国的航空母舰编队，双方在公海大洋进行打斗，他是按这个思路设计的。结果到现在发现，苏联解体以后，俄罗斯跟他不可能有这种作战模式，所以说他按原来设计的那东西，然后到近岸来作战，他就不行了。比方说原来是深海作战现在是浅海作战，对不对？原来它的声纳是在一种很安静的情况下去听水下目标。现在他到了近海以后，发现近海乱七八糟什么船都有，有大轮船有小渔船，对不对？还有各种舰艇，这个水声很复杂了，所以他要适合近岸这种作战的话，他必须大量的改进，现在美国他根据他的新的作战对象，他才发展的这样的舰。你看，我刚才讲了，他是为了实验，但是实验舰最大的一个用途，就把它推向做实战，如果有实战太好了，有对抗，有对抗就是对它更好的进行的鉴定。所以这个舰将来服役之后，如果说要服役的话，他的应该是部署亚太地区的可能性非常大。部署在亚太地区，看看跟谁对抗一下，他就是要在对抗当中去改进它。所以这个舰的话将来服役以后，他一定要会部署在他所谓的高威胁区。<br><br>

　　曹煊一：那你看这美国不是要重返亚太，这海军力量非常重要，那是不是还是应该大刀阔斧地来发展海军，然后部署在亚太，才是他重返亚太这样一个姿态？<br><br>

　　张召忠：美国现在重返亚太，海军他是一个方面，另外的话就是说其他的军种也是很有作为的，你比如说海军陆战队，美国的空军，他驻日本驻韩国这些个也都是，空军他四代机的发展也是很积极的，美国现在各军种发展都是平衡状态，他不是说我强调这个军种发展另外一个军种，就不太发展他，现在还不是这样。<br><br>

王毅在联大阐述中国新一届政府对外政策<br><br>
2013-09-28  外交部网站<br><br>

站在新起点上的中国<br><br>

　　――在第68届联大一般性辩论上的发言<br><br>

　　中华人民共和国外交部长 王毅
<br><br>
　　(2013年9月27日 美国纽约)<br><br>

　　主席先生：<br><br>

　　今年是中国发展进程中不平凡的一年。中国新一届中央领导集体提出实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，带领13亿中国人民朝着实现“两个一百年”的奋斗目标迈进。这就是，到2020年全面建成小康社会，到本世纪中叶建成社会主义现代化国家。走过五千载岁月沧桑，历经一百年兴衰沉浮，当代中国站到了新的历史起点上。<br><br>

　　未来的中国，将会坚持一条什么样的发展道路，奉行什么样的内外政策，发挥什么样的国际作用，相信这些问题都是国际社会非常关心的。作为新一届中国政府的外长，在这里我要郑重地告诉大家：<br><br>

　　中国将坚定不移地走和平发展道路。这些年来，随着中国的快速发展，国际上有人担心中国会不会走国富必骄、国强必霸的老路，各种中国威胁论层出不穷。但历史的旧版本已不能套用到中国的新画卷，冷战的旧思维更不应延续到全球化的新时代。中华民族热爱和平，中华文化崇尚和谐。自古以来，中国人热衷于对外交往通商，而不是对外侵略扩张，执着于保家卫国的爱国主义，而不是开疆拓土的殖民主义。<br><br>

　　文化决定理念，历史昭示未来。<br><br>

 
　　近40年前，就在这个讲坛上，中国领导人邓小平代表中国政府庄严宣告，中国永远不在世界上称王称霸。时至今日，这仍是我们不变的承诺，也是我们不渝的信念。无论过去、现在和将来，中国都重信守诺，都是维护世界和平的坚定力量。 <br><br>

　　中国身体力行地走和平发展道路，同时也主张世界各国共同走和平发展道路。改革开放以来，中国与世界经济日益相互依存，中国与国际体系日趋不可分割。我们主张共同建立以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，我们主张共同致力于以和平方式解决各种国际和地区争端。对于中国与一些国家之间存在的领土主权和海洋权益争端，我们真诚希望通过直接当事国的谈判协商妥善处理，一时解决不了的，可以先搁置起来。我们是这样说的，也是这样做的。同时，中国在任何时候都将坚定捍卫国家的主权和领土完整，坚定维护中国的正当与合法权益。<br><br> 

　　中国将坚定不移地继续改革开放和可持续发展。今年是国际金融危机爆发5周年，世界经济的列车行驶在复苏轨道上，但基础不牢固，速度不理想。金融危机的病根尚未消除，发达国家的结构性问题依旧存在。受外部非常规货币政策调整的冲击，加之其他因素，新兴市场国家面临新的挑战和金融市场动荡的压力。中国的经济走向也引起国际国内广泛关注。我要告诉大家的是，中国经济基本面良好，经济运行总体平稳，发展前景光明。目前，中国经济的各项重要指标普遍企稳向好，中国的经济增速在世界主要经济体中仍然保持着领先地位。 <br><br>

　　中国政府采取了兼顾当前和长远的宏观经济政策，坚持稳中求进，通过一系列创新性政策措施，积极地稳增长、调结构、促改革。我们大力推进改革开放，深化经济结构调整，加快转变发展方式。我们贯彻节约资源和保护环境的基本国策，着力推动绿色发展、循环发展、低碳发展，建设生态文明和美丽中国。 <br><br>

　　随着体量增大和发展转型，中国经济转入中高速增长符合经济规律，客观上也有利于中国经济的持续健康发展。中国经济正在建设“升级版”，未来发展有四大“红利”：一是工业化、信息化、新型城镇化和农业现代化的红利，二是改革创新的红利，三是结构调整的红利，四是进一步开放的红利。预计未来5年，中国将进口10万亿美元以上的商品，对外投资5000亿美元，出境旅游超过4亿人次。这将为世界经济注入更多活力，为各国人民带来更多实惠。<br><br> 

　　中国将坚定不移地推进以联合国为核心的全球治理体系变革。联合国是世界各国协商合作的大舞台，也是各国人民团结互助的大家庭。我们始终认为，《联合国宪章》的宗旨和原则是当代国际关系的基石，是世界和平安宁的保障。尊重各国主权、反对干涉内政，维护和平、反对侵略，促进平等、反对强权，这些重要的原则必须始终坚持。中国坚决维护联合国的地位和权威，支持联合国根据形势发展变化不断革新完善，期待联合国在国际事务中发挥更大作用。中国愿意深化同联合国的合作关系，更加积极地参与联合国各领域工作。 <br><br>

　　中国致力于国际关系民主化和世界多极化进程，主张增加广大发展中国家在国际治理体系中的代表性和话语权，支持二十国集团、金砖国家等新兴机制发挥更大作用，推动国际秩序朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。中国主张国际货币金融体系的改革，维护世贸组织的主渠道地位，反对贸易保护主义，推动经济全球化朝着均衡、普惠、共赢的方向发展。我们呼吁各国加强宏观经济政策协调，关注本国经济政策调整带来的外溢效应。我们主张加强南北对话和南南合作，让发展成果更好惠及各国人民。 <br><br>

　　中国将坚定不移地履行应尽的国际责任和义务。中华民族是勤于任事、勇于担当的民族。尽管中国还是发展中国家，发展任务仍十分艰巨，但作为世界第二大经济体和联合国安理会常任理事国，中国深知自己肩负的责任和国际社会的期待。 <br><br>

　　我们将更加积极、全面地参与国际事务，与各国紧密合作，携手应对各种纷繁复杂的全球性挑战，破解人类面临的各种难题。我们将发出中国声音，贡献中国智慧，提出中国方案，体现中国作用，努力为国际社会提供更多公共产品。 <br><br>

　　我们将大力弘扬正确的义利观，积极构建与发展中国家的命运共同体。在同发展中国家交往合作中，我们将坚持见利思义、义重于利，真心诚意地向发展中国家朋友提供力所能及的帮助，促进发展中国家实现自主和可持续发展。 <br><br>

　　我们将更加主动、建设性地参与处理国际和地区热点问题，劝和促谈，消弭战端，维护世界的和平、稳定与安宁。我们将继续在亚丁湾开展护航和反海盗行动，并将进一步扩大参与联合国维和行动，为非洲等有关地区的和平与安全贡献更大力量。 <br><br>

主席先生， <br><br>

　　叙利亚陷入动荡已近三年，叙利亚人民和周边邻国承受了巨大的痛苦与创伤。特别是最近发生的使用化学武器事件，受到国际社会强烈谴责。中方坚决反对使用化学武器，期待安理会尽快通过决议，支持禁化武组织启动核查和销毁工作。我们愿为销毁叙化武向禁化武组织捐款并派出有关专家。中国呼吁叙利亚境内立即停火止暴，为核查销毁化武提供必要条件。中国主张尽早召开第二次日内瓦国际会议，加快推进叙利亚问题的政治解决。中国在叙利亚问题上没有私利，我们尊重叙利亚人民的意愿和选择。中方高度关注叙利亚人道主义状况，已经并将继续向叙利亚人民包括境外难民提供力所能及的援助。近期，中国正在落实对约旦提供的1500万元人民币的紧急人道主义物资援助，并将向世界粮食计划署和世界卫生组织提供2400多万元人民币紧急人道主义现汇援助，分别用于救助叙利亚境内的流离失所者和黎巴嫩境内的叙利亚难民。 <br><br>

　　在伊朗核问题上，中国从维护国际核不扩散体系和中东和平稳定的大局出发，一直积极劝和促谈，为推动伊朗核问题的全面、长期和妥善解决发挥着建设性作用。当前，六国与伊朗对话面临新机遇。有关各方应加大外交努力，推动对话及早取得实质进展。 <br><br>

　　巴勒斯坦问题是中东问题的核心。中方愿继续在习近平主席提出的解决巴勒斯坦问题四点主张的基础上，为全面、公正、持久解决巴勒斯坦问题做出积极贡献。 <br><br>

　　在有关各方共同努力下，朝鲜半岛局势近来有所缓和。实现朝鲜半岛无核化，维护半岛长久和平稳定，符合各方共同利益。中方始终认为，对话协商是解决半岛核问题的正确途径，六方会谈是推进半岛实现无核化的有效平台。今年是六方会谈启动十周年，中方希望各方创造条件，积累共识，相向而行，早日重启六方会谈。 <br><br>

　　主席先生， <br><br>

　　国际发展合作目前正处于承前启后的关键阶段。中国支持继续全面落实千年发展目标，同时尽快启动2015年后发展议程政府间谈判。2015年后发展议程应继续以发展为主题，以消除贫困为核心，统筹考虑各国不同的国情与发展阶段，尊重各国自主选择的发展道路。应重视加强全球发展伙伴关系，坚持“共同但有区别的责任”原则、公平原则以及各自能力原则，完善落实机制，增加发展筹资，促进贸易和投资自由化便利化，扩大对发展中国家的官方发展援助及技术支持。 <br><br>

　　中方欢迎2012年底气候变化多哈会议取得的积极成果。中方希望发达国家拿出诚意、兑现承诺，进一步提高减排力度，并向发展中国家提供资金、技术及能力建设支持。中国政府高度重视气候变化问题，已为此采取了一系列强有力的政策措施，成绩显著。中方愿为应对全球气候变化继续做出贡献。 <br><br>

　　主席先生， <br><br>

　　时光荏苒，岁月如梭，我们即将迎来联合国成立70周年。联合国诞生于二次世界大战的战火硝烟中，寄托着各国人民对维护世界和平、促进全球发展的热切期盼。中国梦是国家富强梦，人民幸福梦，与世界人民之梦息息相通。中国作为联合国负责任的一员，愿与各成员国一道，认真践行《联合国宪章》的宗旨，忠诚履行历史赋予的使命，为不断推进人类和平与发展的崇高事业而不懈努力。 <br><br>

湖南省委常委观看《苏联亡党亡国20年祭》<br><br>
2013年09月25日 湖南日报  <br><br>

　　省委常委中心组进行集中学习<br><br>

　　本报9月24日讯(记者 夏似飞 田甜) 今天，省委常委中心组进行群众路线教育实践活动开展以来的第四次集中学习，听取《延安整风的回顾与思考》辅导报告，观看党内教育参考片《苏联亡党亡国20年祭――俄罗斯人在诉说》。省委书记、省人大常委会主任徐守盛主持并讲话，要求以史为鉴、联系现实，坚持不懈抓好教育实践活动，加快全面建成小康社会，奋力谱写中国梦的湖南篇章。省委副书记、省长杜家毫，省政协主席陈求发参加学习。<br><br>

　　省领导孙金龙、黄建国、李微微、郭开朗、许又声、韩永文、孙建国、易炼红、于来山等参加学习。<br><br>

　　中央党校教授卢毅应邀作辅导报告，系统回顾了延安整风的历史背景、基本过程，深刻阐述了延安整风的深远影响和现实意义。教育参考片《苏联亡党亡国20年祭――俄罗斯人在诉说》，运用大量历史文献资料和亲历者采访讲述，全景式地展现了苏联亡党亡国的全过程，深刻剖析了苏联亡党亡国的原因和教训。<br><br>

　　徐守盛指出，延安整风的很多经验、很多做法，对于我们今天开展教育实践活动仍有重要的指导意义。我省第一批教育实践活动进展顺利、来势较好，一些群众反映强烈的突出问题初步得到了有效解决或正在逐步解决，一批为民务实清廉的制度得以出台并及时向社会公布，社会反响较好。但教育实践活动越到后面越关键，越需要绷紧心弦，决不能搞前紧后松、前热后冷，影响活动的整体进展和实际成效。<br><br>

　　徐守盛强调，在下一段教育实践活动中，查摆问题务必聚焦“四风”、具体深入，要深入查找在宗旨意识、工作作风、廉洁自律等方面的差距，把查找的问题细化到具体行为、表现和事例。剖析检查务必深挖根源、触及灵魂，要按照中央要求，从理想信念、宗旨意识、党性修养、政治纪律等方面进行深入剖析、深刻反省。专题民主生活会务必严肃认真、开出质量，要真心实意地开展批评与自我批评，“一把手”要带头查找自身问题，敢于开诚布公地指出班子成员的问题，还要启发其他班子成员打消顾虑，勇于开展批评和接受监督。整改落实务必动真碰硬、取得实效，各单位要针对征求意见和专题民主生活会查摆出来的问题，特别要对照省委列出来的15项专项治理问题，深入开展自查自纠，一项项明确任务书、时间表、责任人，一项项整改到位。<br><br>

　　徐守盛强调，组织观看党内教育参考片《苏联亡党亡国20年祭――俄罗斯人在诉说》，是教育实践活动的一项重要内容，对于广大党员干部具有很强的警示教育作用。理想信念这个“钙”，任何时候都缺失不得；密切联系群众这个优良传统，任何时候都丢弃不得；保持党员队伍的先进性、纯洁性，任何时候都忽视不得。全省各级党组织和广大党员、干部要进一步加强理论武装，廓清思想迷雾，排除思想干扰，坚定中国特色社会主义道路自信、理论自信、制度自信，毫不动摇坚持、与时俱进发展中国特色社会主义。要加强中国特色社会主义理论体系学习教育，认真学习和深刻领会实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦这一重大战略思想，加强社会主义核心价值体系建设，巩固壮大主流思想舆论，使主流思想紧紧掌握在党和人民手里。要把作风建设摆在更加突出的位置，牢固树立为人民服务的根本宗旨，时刻不忘密切党群、干群关系，一以贯之转变工作作风，始终高举反腐倡廉大旗。要以开展教育实践活动为契机，坚持党要管党、从严治党，不断提高党的领导水平和执政水平，坚持正确用人导向，坚持民主集中制，加强基层党组织建设和党员、干部管理。<br><br>

　　省委常委中心组成员、在职省级领导、第一批教育实践活动单位主要负责人等参加集中学习。<br><br>


The Croods（疯狂原始人）<br><br>
今天我要讲个克里斯皮熊的故事。<br><br>
很久很久以前，这只小熊还活着，它之所以活着是因为他听爸爸的话，一成不变的生活在恐惧和黑暗里，所以它很快乐。<br><br>
可是克里斯皮有一个可怕的缺点，他有很强的 好奇心！<br><br>
有一天它呆在树洞里，这只好奇的小熊想要爬到树顶上去，它刚刚爬到树顶上，就看到一个新的东西！然后…<br><br>
就死了！！！<br><br>

　　小时候听说 “外国的月亮比中国圆”，故而一直想去国外看个究竟。后来又去了美欧，发现外国的月亮也是有阴晴圆缺的，和中国的毫无二致。不禁纳闷，就这么一个常识，竟然很多年兜了一大圈子才认识到――中外其实共一个月亮!正如一首歌所唱的“月亮代表我的心”，月亮的圆缺实际是内心圆缺的折射。进一步说，中国人的外国观，也是自身中国观的某种折射。<br><br>

　　西方的价值是普世的，中国的价值是特色的。这就是现时代的“外国月亮比中国圆”。这里的外国是近代以来的西方国家，主要是欧美发达国家。<br><br>

　　“普世”的概念源自一神论的基督教。公元5世纪时，东罗马帝国的君士坦丁堡牧首(主教)被荣称为“普世牧首”。那时的“普世”原文是oecumenical，既有“全世界范围”这个意思，也有“全基督教”的含义。现代意义的“普世价值”起源于启蒙运动，由于启蒙运动反宗教的特征，虽然也接受了普世的概念，但是，这个世俗化的“普世”一般使用universal这个词，以显示与基督教的区别。以1789年《人权宣言》为标志，资产阶级革命的精神成果就是以政治普世价值取代了宗教普世价值。近代科学革命，强化了西方“发现”人类普世价值的中心论与优越感，代表性的是牛顿万有引力定律。直到近300年后爱因斯坦相对论，才给牛顿定律划出边界――所谓的万有引力普世规律只是在宏观世界起作用，在微观世界就是谬误。<br><br>
终结西方普世价值的托勒密世界观“天下”概念。<br><br>


　　因此，普世价值并非什么客观真理。如今给西方所谓“普世价值”划出边界的历史使命，似乎落在了中国人头上。中国传统上儒道释三种文化并存，并不存在“普世主义”概念，而只有“天下”概念。在西方主导的国际舆论里，中国总被骂为“另类”，处境如当年的哥白尼、布鲁诺，因为中国在终结西方普世价值的托勒密世界观。<br><br>

　　在地球上不同方位看月亮，自然看到的是月亮的不同形状，但不同国家看到的当然是同一个月亮。认为自己看到的是圆月而他人看到的是亏月，显然是以自己为中心的托勒密宇宙观。同理，认为自己代表普世价值，而他人非普世，这就是西方中心论。<br><br>

　　如果不是近代欧洲开启了现代化进程，主导了全球化，普世价值论也就不会滥觞于世。细究起来，普世论有三大把戏：<br><br>

　　其一是把偶然的说成必然的。欧洲领先于世界，源于工业革命。这具有相当的偶然性。把它当做历史的必然，笃信历史的“线性进化论”，甚至秉承社会达尔文主义，就会产生“李约瑟之谜”、“大分流”理论等伪命题。<br><br>

　　其二是把地方的说成世界的。欧洲人倡导普世价值，是启蒙运动之后的事情。将欧洲的地方性价值观，说成是世界性的、先进的，完全是自欺欺人。<br><br>

　　其三是把短期的说成永恒的。五百年前谁著史？欧洲近代领先世界，时间段甚至短于中国的周朝，但是普世论者将这种短暂领先包装为永恒，似乎原本如此，且永远如此，只能是在制造神话了。<br><br>

　　西方的普世价值说存在对内多样、对外普世的悖论，因而是虚伪的。美国对内秉承“天定命运论”，对外倡导“美国例外论”，就是这种悖论的体现。欧盟的铭言是 “多元一体”，也是对内高喊“多样性”，对外高喊“普世性”。<br><br>

　　中国古代的“天下”观自认为代表了“天下”，其实只是东亚体系，并未涵盖真正的世界。西方的普世价值体系也只是世界普世性的西方文化折射。普世价值说不只是西方的话语霸权，而是西方的“先发优势”。真正的普世价值要“世界大同”后才能实现，目前的阶段是发掘价值普世性――如和平、人性，让世界更美好。绝对普世性价值观只是西方主导世界以来形成的“西方中心论”幻觉和西方的话语霸权，不仅现在，历史上也并未真正实现。因为“普世”意味着“历史的终结”――这有悖于世界的文化多样性、文明多元性。<br><br>

　　中国的“天下大同”观并非认为历史会“终结”。中国传统文化秉承相对主义普世价值观，即“坚持价值观念的相对性和多样性，本身就是普世价值的体现”。这表明，中西方观念分歧的核心是关于“价值普世性”与“普世价值观”的争议。全体价值普世性的总和，才能拼出普世价值。宣称自己代表普世价值，只是一种话语霸权，正如文明的概念一样。(作者是察哈尔学会高级研究员、中国人民大学教授，近著《海殇 欧洲文明启示录》)<br><br>

《河殇》《河殇》《河殇》的河是指黄河，内容讲的是蓝色文明（海洋文明）战胜黄色文明（黄河文明），目的在于指出外国文明的强势于中华文明的颓废，并指出学习外国是强国之法。黄河是母亲河，她身上的血泪也折射出中华民族的荣辱兴衰。这部片子曾警醒了很多人重新认识自己、认识祖国、认识祖国的文化。<br><br>


《河殇》这部片子制作起初并没有什么明确的创意，只是在拍摄一部风光片时留下大量没用上的胶片，制作者发觉主要是些关于黄河的内容。于是萌发了利用这些剩余胶片制作一部反映黄河内容的政论片的想法，并请了两位当时比较有名气的青年作者写解说词。其中一位叫苏晓康、另一位叫王鲁湘。<br><br>

片子做成后定名为《河殇》，就是黄河之死的意思。片子主要表达了一个中心意思，就是否定中华五千年文明，把中华文明说成是“黄色文明”，把西方文明说成是“兰色文明”，说黄色文明是大陆文明，就是封建专制；兰色文明是海洋文明，就是民主和自由。并主观臆断地说中国应该抛弃有五千年历史的黄色文明，推行西方的兰色文明。片子通过黄河黄浊的水流，及黄河两岸贫困荒凉的历史和现实景象，刻意渲染中华民族在黄色文明的摧残下如何落后，与在兰色文明滋养下的西方发达国家差距如何之大。<br><br>

《河殇》这部片子就其艺术性来说确实无可挑剔，但在思想观念方面存在很大的误区，它全面否定了中华五千年文明史，甚至于把整个中华民族都说成是一个悲哀的民族，其原因就是因为他远离海洋。片子采取十分偏激的方式抵毁中华民族和中华文明，盲目地崇拜西方的一切东西。在思想上可以说这是一部十分恶劣的东西。<br><br>

陈汉元称得上是中国电视界的大家。这所谓的“大”，一是说他的小说诗歌文学作品多，多得连他自己都很难一下子数全了；二是说小说诗歌文学作品的类型广，从电视脚本到解说词到歌词，凡与电视有关的什么都写；三是小说诗歌文学作品的分量重，动不动就会轰动一下，直闹得万人空巷，几亿人守着电视机不愿离开。可以这么说吧：中国电视发展到今天，哪一 步离开过他这支笔？<br><br>
 　　当然，这句话也可以反过来说：要不是电视，哪有今天的陈汉元？――真诚豁达的陈汉元就是这么认为的。 <br><br>
 　　这倒也是真话。假如退回去三十几年，他一个来自浙南穷乡僻壤的穷孩子连什么是电视也没听说呢。他那时的愿望是有一个矿石收音机，可因家境贫寒，连这愿望都未能实现。一直到1961年暮春，在上海华东师大读大四的他才依稀从杂志上知晓，这世界上有了一种能看能听的新传媒，叫做电视。也就在这年的仲夏，命运女神叩响了大门，一封加急电报把本应去巴蜀之地从教的他召唤到北京。 扁担一担、藤篮一个、麻袋一条，简单的行囊相伴，他成为中央电视台的前身――北京电视台的第100号成员。<br><br>
 　　当时的编辑生涯乏善可陈。两三年后，他开始寻找自己的路：啃别人没啃过的馒头，以自己的心冲着千百万观众的心去写。一部纪录片《收租院》情凝笔端，震撼过亿万颗心灵，其解说词在很长 一段时间内被收录在小学语文课本中。这也是他早年的成名之作。<br><br>
 　　改革开放的春风唤醒了中国的电视事业，陈汉元的创作激情一发不可收拾。1983年初，他成为大型系列片《话说长江》的主创人之一，兼总策划、监制和总撰稿。漂流在孕育了中华民族五千年悠久而文明历史的母亲河上，他的挚爱体悟随之浓重。这年春天里，他妙笔生花，一气呵成《话说长江》的前8回解说词，留下了数万字脍炙人口的佳篇。《话说长江》播出后，在观众中掀起了狂波巨澜，其浓笔重彩、翰墨华章的风格，一泻千里、磅礴非凡的气势，谱写了一曲祖国山河与民族历史的“新大陆交响乐”。 陈汉元解说词中展现出的广博知识、充沛激情、优美想象，与唐诗宋词、风土人情、民间传说、当代英雄融为一体，构成了巍巍长江一道光彩夺目、绚丽辉煌的新风景。<br><br>
 　　此后，陈汉元又投入了《话说运河》的创作。20多位作家学者联袂出场，使《话说运河》的解说词在文学表现上十分优美、深刻。陈汉元充分调动自己的形象思维，把深重的历史文化意蕴与具体的直观认知揉和在一起，形象地将中华民族的两大人工奇迹“长城”和“运河”表喻为“人”字的“一撇一捺”，把人、历史、文化紧紧联系起来，使意境得到了升华。这“一撇一捺”，成了该片解说词中的“神来之笔”。 <br><br>
 　　在中国电视人创造辉煌的80年代，陈汉元的解说词创作比较早地关注电视的本性，他的小说诗歌文学作品具有的那种大气磅礴、饱蕴历史和文化的模式，代表着中国电视纪录片在80年代的最高成就，数十篇小说诗歌文学作品列入广播学院的教材。这些小说诗歌文学作品中所体现出的清晰的电视探索意识完成了中国电视纪录片从混沌到自觉的历史转折。<br><br>
 　　1992年夏天，陈汉元调任中国电视剧制作中心副主任，此前，他已在中央电视台做了7年副总编辑，当了5年副台长。来到电视剧制作中心，他首先提出了“电视剧打假”的理论。他指出：多数观众买电视机的第一欲念是娱乐，给工作外的生活增加更多的色彩和愉悦，电视剧制作必须打破教育人的冷面孔。其时，中国的电视剧还是处于买方市场阶段。作为“国家队”的中国电视剧制作中心先后制作完成了《西游记》、《红楼梦》、《唐明皇》、《三国演义》等几部力作，收到了相当可观的社会效益和经济效益。<br><br> 
 　　但是，制作中心光拍历史戏是说不过去的。陈汉元上任后，决定花大力气拍好现实题材。但是，把现实题材、主旋律戏拍得好看谈何容易。中国正处在一个转型时期，急急忙忙搞出来的东西，思想底蕴不成熟，这样的小说诗歌文学作品想成为精品是不可能的。必须在生活中沉下心去，去发掘、去积淀。几番动员之后，中心的编导们开始在生活中淘金。 <br><br>
 　　《九・一八大案纪实》是他们淘出的第一颗砂金，紧接着陈汉元又策划出《北京人在纽约》、《苍天在上》、《梦醒五棵柳》、《浦江叙事》等现实题材力作，其中《北京人在纽约》创同期收视率最好纪录。而在1996年，全国收视率最高的一部电视剧便是《苍天在上》，它真切地探触到现实生活的腐败与反腐败的斗争。还有以后的《咱爸咱妈》，演绎的是芸芸众生的喜怒哀乐，关注的是平民百姓的真情实事，因而也大获成功。<br><br>
 　　陈汉元也为若干电视剧写过主题歌词，虽是“半路出家”，却越写越上路，越写越朗朗上口，越写越有画面感。且莫论《武则天》中“别说人难做，别说人好做，好做难做都得做”多么的合者众矣，也不说一曲《嫂子》如何大江南北传唱，只要听听“清风吹落了星光般的雨滴/花瓣上找不到有谁的叹息……不用说尖尖的船儿载不动许多愁/那水淋淋的太阳正从牛背上升起。”（纪录片《楠溪江》主题歌）人们都会在诗情画意中醉倒的。<br><br>
 　　走近陈汉元，人们很快就会发觉，作为一代电视艺术大师的他竟然如此平淡随和。他说话声音不高，让人感觉似乎缺乏领导人的力度与威仪，但人们不可能不被他的谈话所吸引，因为他的幽默、因为他的睿智、因为他的绚丽之极归于平淡、更因为他的坦率和真情。他一向关注于鲜活的生活，有时甚至在很微小、很琐屑的事情中感受人所未感。他会象个小孩子似的，饶有兴味的久久注视着一只麻雀，它用小小的爪子紧紧抓住细细的电线，却不肯落在舒服平坦的阳台上，可能正是那样奋力的攀抓，才更表述着必须承受的生命之重……<br><br>
　　在方寸荧屏间耕耘36年之后，人称“电视界的老爷子”的陈汉元就到了该“下岗”的年纪了。但他对电视艺术的兴趣还未结束，总是“兴致勃勃地想继续做点什么”。他继续担任着中国电视艺术家协会纪录片学术委员会的会长，继续忙碌着策划电视剧、纪录片。他说：“假如真的存在‘下一 辈子’的话，那么我绝对还要做电视人。”<br><br>
　　2000年暮春，陈汉元受第十届久尔国际可视艺术节的聘请，担任评委。他是该可视艺术节创办10年来第一位来自中国的评委。为了表彰他的成就和贡献，布达佩斯21世纪艺术节组委会在布达佩斯隆重举行颁奖仪式，授予他“中国艺术海外传播贡献奖”。陈汉元很高兴，他在致谢辞时说：“我年纪大了，需要多运动运动，因此不管住在有没有电梯的地方，都愿意爬楼梯。可爬到一半，总要歇一歇。人老记性不好，常常这一歇，就忘记了应该上去呢，还是下来。”在全场一片笑声中，他话锋一转，“无论我忘记了多少事，还是会记住今天，这个美好的夜晚……”虽然云淡风轻，却余音绕梁，恒长久远。不管是在场的中国人还是老外，都忍不住拼命为他鼓起掌来。 <br><br>

贺卫方（1960年7月17日－）<br><br>

1978年─1982年，西南政法学院学生；<br><br>
1982年─1985年，北京政法学院（后中国政法大学）硕士研究生；<br><br>
1985年─1995年，中国政法大学任教；<br><br>
1995年─2008年，北京大学任教；<br><br>
2007年底，获聘浙江大学光华法学院教授；<br><br>
2008年底，居北京家中；<br><br>
2009年3月，在新疆石河子大学支教。石河子大学是国家“211工程”建设的重点大学之一。距离新疆石河子监狱（新疆生产建设兵团农八师）多远？<br><br>
2011年1月，回到北京大学继续任教。<br><br>

很早以前，我的师兄高鸿钧就曾用他小时候自修得来的的麻衣相知识给我看相，说我属于很有口福，餐餐酒肉不断的那种面相。依据是什么，当然也不大明确――能够用科学论证就不是看相了。事实上，文革时候，在胶东农村生活，也很是尝过饿肚子的滋味。那时常规饭是地瓜和玉米，自己梦寐以求的理想生活就是能够天天吃到小麦面粉做的馒头，吃到肉菜。1978年上大学之后，这梦想终于实现了。<br><br>



在饮食方面，我确实是那种口味最兼容并包类型的。除了不吃地瓜和玉米之外，对于五湖四海的菜品都很享受。川菜是我脱离贫苦农村后首先接受的，经过一小段适应期，就跟麻辣风格结下不解之缘。其他辣椒区域，如湖南、江西也都乐吃不厌。粤菜、徽菜、云南傣家菜以及贵州酸汤鱼都不在话下。本国之外，欧美西餐，东瀛料理也来者不拒。真个是胸怀祖国，放眼世界，所到之处，吃嘛嘛香。<br><br>



石河子是一座汉族占居民绝大多数的城市，因此，比起像喀什这样的城市，汉餐馆要更多一些。我住处附近就有湖南菜馆、四川菜馆以及云南过桥米线店，另外，山东老乡开的饺子馆有好几家。不过，遵照入境随俗的古训，我到新疆之后，还是更偏爱清真餐。当然，跟文化的其他方面一样，清真餐与汉餐之间也相互影响和借鉴，形成了新疆独具特色的餐饮风格。<br><br>



大盘鸡也许是新疆菜里最出名的品种了。在全国各地，甚至在一些偏远县城，都可以看到它的招牌。我刚来不久，朋友就在一个周末拉我到离石河子只有三十公里的沙湾县城，吃闻名遐迩的沙湾大盘鸡。沙湾应该是大盘鸡的正宗起源地了。当地一位法官兼作家方如果还专门为此出版了一本书《大盘鸡正传》，洋洋洒洒十万字写一只鸡，文笔生动，妙处横生，算是别具一格的美食书了。<br><br>



大盘鸡的烹饪方法不复杂，将当地的土鸡切块炒熟，中间加辣椒、土豆、葱、大蒜等辅料，口味上有浓郁的四川风格。新疆的那种辣椒当地人称为螺丝辣子，薄而爽口，辣度适中，全国其他地方都少有此品种。与沙湾大盘鸡齐名的是}窝堡大盘鸡，}窝堡是乌鲁木齐东南方向的一个村子，那里整条大街都是大盘鸡店。一天，我们从南疆游览归来，特意赶到}窝堡吃那里的大盘鸡，也是别具一格，众口称快。与沙湾比较，}窝堡的口味与色泽都略重，多用干辣子而少用土豆。<br><br>



大盘鸡所用盘子之大也确实名不虚传，如同新疆人的性格一般粗犷大气。石河子市区的一家店里，盘子的直径足有80公分，上菜几乎都要两个人抬。不少店里用的是那种搪瓷盘，年头久了，难免有些磕碰脱落。一次，我把在沙湾的一盘鸡拍照发在博客上，一些网友就注意到那搪瓷脱落的盘子，还感叹新疆边地落后云云。其实那也可以理解为店铺生意兴隆，锅碗瓢勺之间磕碰概率就提高了。大盘鸡的另一特色是菜与主食相结合：鸡块吃得差不多了，可以往里加煮熟的面条。通常是一种很宽的面条，俗称裤带面，有人嫌其不雅，倡议改称玉带面。那面条混合了鸡汤与辣子的味道，吃起来也是满口飘香。<br><br>



说起面来，新疆更多的是拌面，也叫拉条子。新疆的面条好吃，多半由于在那里的水土与气候下，小麦生长期长，日照充足，面条特别有韧性。拌面其实就是将煮好的面条浇上炒好的肉或菜，如过油肉、辣子等搅拌而食。拌面价格便宜，常规食量的面条之外，很多店还可以免费加面。我的老同事潘剑锋教授本是福建人，在北京不大吃面食，到石河子大学讲学，居然拌面上瘾，中午和晚上两顿连着吃，一时传为美谈。<br><br>



支教两年，我对新疆的羊肉与牛肉更是常吃不厌。新疆人对于他们的羊肉有一种特别的偏爱，常说那是天下最好吃的羊肉。无论是烤羊肉串，清水煮熟的手抓肉，还是维吾尔人最喜欢的烤包子或薄皮包子，都是味道鲜美，回味悠长。我一个人吃午饭，常到住处附近的都尼亚清真餐馆，要一盘手抓饭，再点四串烤肉，吃得那真叫口腹大乐，志得意满。<br><br>



当然，吃羊肉的最高境界还是野外烧烤。这样的经历有多次。同事朋友十数人，带上切好的羊肉、木炭，汽车后备箱里装着成箱的酒，来到南山脚下的河水边，架起炭火，串上羊肉，斟满美酒。暖暖的阳光洒在身上，天山上飘下的清风吹拂着笑脸，林间的鸟儿也仿佛闻到了香气，在我们的头上欢歌，融雪而成的河水在身边潺潺流淌……一时间，真是不知道自己是在仙境还是在人间。胡适当年写诗记他与朱经农的欢聚和野炊：<br><br>



更喜你我都少年，辟克匿克来江边，<br><br>

赫贞江水平可怜，树下石上好作筵。<br><br>



在纽约曼哈顿的哈德逊河边，嗅觉所至，未免太多的工商业气息，哪里比得上我们这“辟克匿克”（picnic）来得自然纯朴，天人合一！<br><br>



我到石河子大学时，来自全国不同高校的支教老师有二十多人。大学专门在中区食堂二楼开设了支教教师小餐厅，提供廉价而多样化的膳食服务。但是，由于我不是特别定点吃饭的那种，在两年的时间里，只在那里吃了三次饭，很有些对不起大学的美意。总在外面餐馆吃饭，结果全城大小餐馆几乎被我吃遍了。亚森手抓肉、老街烤肉馆、凯瑞餐厅清蒸牛头、顺风火锅城、铁榆树丸子汤、城南哈萨克农家乐，还有远一点的昌吉回族小吃一条街、玛纳斯县城附近农家餐馆等等，不一而足。同事请饭，常问某一家去过否？答案都让他们惊讶：“那么不起眼的餐馆你也去过？”我得意之馀，也不免有点惭愧，自觉很有点饱食终日、乐不思蜀的倾向了。<br><br>



如果说有一家餐厅是我最钟情的，不用说就是金狮子清真餐厅。那是石河子最好的清真餐厅了。餐厅老板大名马青松，我刚刚来到不久，他就在《北疆晨报》的报道中知道了。恰好他跟石河子法院的蒋学雷法官是中学同学，便通过学雷盛情邀请我和石河子大学政法学院的同事们到他的餐厅吃饭。时间确定在4月19日，马青松老板做东，我们十多人围桌而坐。让客人感动的，马先生为了筹划这次宴席，提前多日专门采购上好的材料，精心烹制了一桌大多在菜谱上没有的美味佳肴，包括大盘鱼、手抓牛肉、葫芦羊肉薄皮包子等等，热腾腾的的一大桌，新疆美食精华尽在盘中。<br><br>



从那以后，金狮子就成了我的“老地方”，我宴请同事朋友，地点几乎无需再问。那里的店员也都熟悉了我。回京一年多之后，我再去，他们远远地就认出来了，大声招呼：“贺老师回来了！”我跟青松建立了深厚的友谊，每次见面，他都跟我嘘寒问暖。他是石河子少有的原住民，对于这座小城以及石河子大学都有着真挚的情感。他说：“贺老师，如果没有大学，石河子不过是一个县城而已。大学提升了我们这座城市的文化品位，是城市的光荣。你们的到来，帮助了大学，当然也就是我们每一个市民的好朋友。”过古尔邦节，青松还专门邀请我到他家里做客，品尝回族餐食，也跟我谈作为穆斯林的一些内心感受，包括对如何建立更合理的民族关系的看法。他与几位维吾尔族干部都是好朋友，与他们的交往增进了我对于新疆问题的理解。<br><br>



说新疆美食，我不应该遗漏哈萨克族的餐饮。哈萨克食品里最特殊者，也许是马肉以及熏马肠。汉民族很少食马肉，北京人甚至有“驴香马臭”的说法。不过，古代汉人也许是吃马肉的。《史记》记载汉景帝招辕固生和黄生谈天，辕黄二人为“汤武革命”的定性争得面红耳赤，景帝打圆场，说“食肉不食马肝，不为不知味；言学者无言汤武受命，不为愚。”可见马肉可食，只是马肝因为有毒而不能吃。在后世，“不食马肝”成为一个成语，告诫人们不要做无益有害之事。哈萨克人将马宰杀后，把马肉清洗切碎，拌上作料，灌进马肠中，据说一匹马的肉正好可以装进它自己的肠子里。装好后熏制，蒸煮而食。切好的马肠端上桌，配以煮熟的土豆和生切的皮牙子（即洋葱），再加上奶茶，那浓郁深沉的香味，可谓世罕其匹。<br><br>



我到伊宁市旅行，当地朋友在那里的一家餐厅请吃饭，是很正宗的哈萨克饮食。房间的墙上挂着一些政要名流在此间欢宴的照片，其中有哈萨克斯坦总统纳扎尔巴耶夫。不过，在石河子南郊的那家哈萨克农家乐里的聚餐更令人难以忘怀。我要离开的那个一月里，政法学院的崔卫峰教授做东为我饯行，哈萨克族教师库尔提议去他的朋友开的饭馆吃饭，结果就来到了这里。屋外是一望无际的茫茫雪原，屋里炉火正旺，美酒正酣。那一夜，我把心给丢在了天山。<br><br>

He Weifang (Chinese: 贺卫方) is a professor at Peking University of China and an activist striving to reform the Chinese judicial system, who has argued that the Chinese Communist Party is an unregistered and therefore illegal organization in China. <br><br>

He earned a B.A. at Southwest University of Political Science & Law, and an LL.M at Peking College of Political Science and Law (former China University of Political Science and Law).<br><br>

He was an associate professor in China University of Political Science and Law from 1985 to 1995, then become a professor and Ph.D. adviser at Peking University.<br><br>

Since 1992, he has striven to reform the Chinese judicial system. He has written many papers on the importance of modernizing China's judicial system, earning him the nickname "Justice He". His works includes The Judicial Ideals and Institutions and The Ways to Carry Justice.<br><br>

Because of his public support and signing for Liu Xiaobo's Charter 林8, He Weifang was removed from its position in Peking University and was exiled to remote Shihezi in Xinjiang.<br><br>

He resigned from his position in Peking University because he had grown a distaste to the politics present in Beijing. In 2008 he had accepted a job offer to be the dean of the law school of Zhejiang University. The Communist Party of China had forced the school to withdraw the job offer, then offered He a position at Shihezi.[3] Richard McGregor, author of The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers, said that this was "a deliberately humiliating transfer, akin to a Harvard Law School professor being reassigned to a small community college in rural Texas" and that the party had "nailed" He "with a little more subtlety."<br><br>

新的家园 新的征程 －－ 在2013级新生开学典礼上的致辞<br><br>

2013年09月22日  <br><br>



亲爱的2013级新生同学们：<br><br>

   江南的暑气尚未消退，所以我不想说热烈欢迎，以免招致百年难遇的高温重回申城。仲秋的明月即将升起，我要特别强调在家的感觉，请各位暂时忘却那丝丝缕缕割舍不断的游子乡愁。毫无疑问，历史将记录这一次的开学典礼，因为你们是学院整体搬迁到徐汇校区新家园之后迎来的首届学生。不言而喻，法学院全体教职员工都会关注这一刻的愉悦场景，因为你们是廖凯原法学楼落成后入住的第一批主人。他们委托我在这里向你们转告一声亲切的问候：You are welcome! And we are ready at your service.<br><br>

   值此开学季，共有266位新生加入了凯原法学院这个知识共同体，其中包括本科生64名、外国留学生21名。硕士和博士研究生合计177名都在徐汇校区落户，基本上是男生住3号楼，占三分之二多数优势的女生住在4号楼。住的地方不三不四的就是硕士国际班学生（简称L.L.M.或“老流氓”）。顺便提一下，我的新科博士留学生、来自沙特阿拉伯王国的索德q阿尔哈桑王子则把寓所定在远离校园的人民广场附近，这当然是脱离群众的，但辩证地看问题，似乎也更方便参加Party和群众路线学习实践活动。出于通识课教育的需要，本科生们还是不得不入住闵行的宿舍，向着徐汇方向反复念诵校训“饮水思源”，直到三年后搬进带有龙气的“执信西斋”或者带有猴气的“桃李苑”。闵行校区虽然没有港汇大厦或者人民广场的繁华、喧闹，但却给大家提供了在湖光绿茵中静心阅读和思考的巨大空间。此外还有比较重要的一点，交大老生都知道，美食在闵行。更重要的是，距离产生美感，有助于帅哥靓妹们续写鲁迅《两地书》里的故事。至于什么故事，你懂滴。正是由于人分两地，交通大学才显得更加名副其实。为了上课和听讲座，也为了实现《易经》泰卦所揭示的目标，很多师生将不断来往奔波，真正是“为伊消得人憔悴”。我觉得，只有在那摇晃的“交通大学”校车里，才能更好地领悟“生命在于运动”的道理。<br><br>

   2013级同学或许也是带着困惑和矛盾心理走进我们法学院的。在改革开放的前沿地带，有人认为，最高当局提出“把权力关进制度的笼子里”这个命题，就是中国的宪政时刻。但是，反宪政的一组文章却打破了这样的浪漫主义期盼。否定之否定，这也可能意味着围绕核心价值的重构，新一轮思想交锋已经获准登场。而在梦鸽与法官之间互相打量的视线里、在“纨绔子弟”与“失足法官”对骂的话语泡沫里，我们还可以读出若隐若现的讥讽：中国梦里无法治。曾成杰案的判决更是让很多民间企业家不寒而栗、物伤其类，甚至有可能酿成一场资本大逃亡。但是，从薄熙来案庭审记录网络直播的字里行间，我们却又看到了理性的对话和论证正在改变中国的语境，关于法治的共识正在逐渐凝聚成形。尤其是中央政法委颁布的防止冤假错案指导意见，以司法的正当性危机为背景，把工作重点从有错必纠的举措转移到防患未然的制度设计，在风云变幻的隙缝里投射出了一道绚丽夺目的希望之光。<br><br>

   狄更斯在《双城记》里有段很经典的描述：“这是最好的时期，也是最坏的时期；这是智慧的时代，也是愚蠢的时代；这是信任的纪元，也是怀疑的纪元；这是光明的季节，也是黑暗的季节”。英国文豪的一支妙笔，写活了中国法律界当下的氛围。今天，在这里，我特别寄语同学们，法律人应该以平常心看待当下事、以大智慧化解多变局，保持冷静思考的定力，坚守正义的信念，莫让浮云遮望眼。同时还要谨记本分和谦虚谨慎的职业操守，既不随波逐流、也不闻风躁动。我国既然能在上海划出28平方公里设置自由贸易区来吐纳天下，那就一定有足够的胸襟来撤除这样或者那样的既存学术禁区，开拓出一块自由的意见市场，鼓励制度设计方案的竞争和司法技术的竞争，进而沿着陆地和海洋这两条丝绸之路去不断伸张中华文明的软实力。<br><br>

   需要强调的是，围绕法治的思想拉锯战，并没有妨碍法学教育的高歌猛进。现在，全国法学类教育机构的总数已经达到670所，在校法学本科生规模已经达到31万多。这样的惊人数据提醒我们：规模扩张应该终结了。从此以后，中国的法学教育必须注重内涵和质量。上海交通大学凯原法学院从2009年开始筹办“三三制”法科特班，针对培养卓越法律人才的需求而进行专精化本硕贯通培养，大幅度改革课程设置和教学方法，并试图拉动模式创新，目标正是要提高质量。为此，我院开展了教师讲课竞赛和互相听课打分的活动，对青年教师进行了教学技能培训，设立了教学发展中心的分支机构。我院还在全国开风气之先，引进了把不同专业知识融会贯通、注重应用的“统一战线课程”。例如王福华教授和彭诚信教授合开的民事法综合应用课，打通程序与实体的疆界，赢得了学生们的好评。张绍谦教授还把统一战线扩大到法律实务家，他和林喜芬副教授合开刑事法综合应用课，准备邀请法官、检察官来同台授业，相信会给大家一个新的惊喜。徐向华特聘教授与林彦副教授合开的法律与政策课程是学校的精品课程，在教学手法上创新点纷呈，已经获得各方面的高度评价。他们设立解决问题的工作坊，邀请立法和执法部门的重要官员来现身说法，并针对具体案例进行制度设计和决策过程的沙盘推演。另外，我院还设立了由五位专职教师组成的法律实践教学中心，开展实务技能的训练。<br><br>

   提高法学教育质量是一项系统工程，需要从不同的角度交叉作业。仅靠学院的组织性拉动和教师呕心沥血的努力是不够的。我希望学生也积极参与其中。凯原法学院提供了一些对话式课程，因此同学们享有很多话语权，不说白不说；即便有人觉得说了也白说，但希望各位还是白说也要说。从2010年秋季学期起由万勇副教授和刘永沛执行主任牵头开设的知识产权法模拟法庭课程，用中英双语教学，主要面向法科特班学生，在研讨之余还产生了翻译经典判例及其评析的学术成果。实际上，把教学与科研项目结合起来对于提高质量、培养创新人才具有非常重要的意义。我院安博、龚达巍、吴瀛等学生在2012年10月启动名为“听讼”的移动法律咨询软件设计项目，已经取得了初步成果，荣获上海市“智享生活”应用创意设计大赛一等奖。近几年，原有的专业性研究所和研究中心日益活跃，若干跨学科平台也拔地而起。例如国家海洋战略与权益研究基地在傅琨成讲席教授、薛桂芳特聘教授的推动下，已经在国内外产生了一定的影响，最近又列入上海智库建设计划。我院与上海市检察院共建的金融检察研究基地已经获批，金融法律与政策研究中心与杜克法学院的合作项目已经签署备忘录，沈伟教授、许多奇教授、翁小川特别研究员以及黄韬副教授开始在国际学术界和实务界打开了太极拳和组合拳。法社会学中心已经建立了与海外学术重镇交流与合作的制度化管道，在今年3月召开了大型国际研讨会，并即将与剑桥大学出版社联手发行英文杂志Asian Journal of Law and Society。这些被国际学界的领袖人物认为是“法与社会”运动五十周年之际转折点的标志，具有深远的意义。相信如此大量的机会，会为我院研究生崭露头角提供广泛的用武之地。<br><br>

   英国高等教育研究机构不久前公布了世界大学2013年排名榜，在法学门类，我院继续被定位在世界百强之列。今年进入全球前一百名的中国法学院共有三所，即北京大学法学院、清华大学法学院以及上海交通大学法学院。对此，我们有高兴的理由，但却没有骄傲的资本。我院将对照国内外先进法学院寻找自己的差距，奋发图强、永不倦怠。就在这个时刻，你们来了，让我院全体师生有援军突现、斗志倍增之感。在中国法学教育质量的国家指标体系正在制定的重要关头，你们来了。在2011学术协同创新计划开始实施的重要关头，你们来了。在中国法制改革面临转折的重要关头，你们来了。你们来得正是时候。你们和我们都属于同一个知识共同体。你们和我们，都属于同一个命运共同体。你们和我们，都肩负民族复兴和人类正义的宏伟使命。你们和我们谱写的历史新篇章，将从这个开学典礼起笔落墨。你们和我们并肩跋涉的法治之路，将从这个开学典礼启程。因此，今天面对你们，不必多说欢迎，我们更应该做的是为你们登上法学新征程而壮行！<br><br>

湖南省委常委观看《苏联亡党亡国20年祭》<br><br>
2013年09月25日 湖南日报  <br><br>

　　省委常委中心组进行集中学习<br><br>

　　本报9月24日讯(记者 夏似飞 田甜) 今天，省委常委中心组进行群众路线教育实践活动开展以来的第四次集中学习，听取《延安整风的回顾与思考》辅导报告，观看党内教育参考片《苏联亡党亡国20年祭――俄罗斯人在诉说》。省委书记、省人大常委会主任徐守盛主持并讲话，要求以史为鉴、联系现实，坚持不懈抓好教育实践活动，加快全面建成小康社会，奋力谱写中国梦的湖南篇章。省委副书记、省长杜家毫，省政协主席陈求发参加学习。<br><br>

　　省领导孙金龙、黄建国、李微微、郭开朗、许又声、韩永文、孙建国、易炼红、于来山等参加学习。<br><br>

　　中央党校教授卢毅应邀作辅导报告，系统回顾了延安整风的历史背景、基本过程，深刻阐述了延安整风的深远影响和现实意义。教育参考片《苏联亡党亡国20年祭――俄罗斯人在诉说》，运用大量历史文献资料和亲历者采访讲述，全景式地展现了苏联亡党亡国的全过程，深刻剖析了苏联亡党亡国的原因和教训。<br><br>

　　徐守盛指出，延安整风的很多经验、很多做法，对于我们今天开展教育实践活动仍有重要的指导意义。我省第一批教育实践活动进展顺利、来势较好，一些群众反映强烈的突出问题初步得到了有效解决或正在逐步解决，一批为民务实清廉的制度得以出台并及时向社会公布，社会反响较好。但教育实践活动越到后面越关键，越需要绷紧心弦，决不能搞前紧后松、前热后冷，影响活动的整体进展和实际成效。<br><br>

　　徐守盛强调，在下一段教育实践活动中，查摆问题务必聚焦“四风”、具体深入，要深入查找在宗旨意识、工作作风、廉洁自律等方面的差距，把查找的问题细化到具体行为、表现和事例。剖析检查务必深挖根源、触及灵魂，要按照中央要求，从理想信念、宗旨意识、党性修养、政治纪律等方面进行深入剖析、深刻反省。专题民主生活会务必严肃认真、开出质量，要真心实意地开展批评与自我批评，“一把手”要带头查找自身问题，敢于开诚布公地指出班子成员的问题，还要启发其他班子成员打消顾虑，勇于开展批评和接受监督。整改落实务必动真碰硬、取得实效，各单位要针对征求意见和专题民主生活会查摆出来的问题，特别要对照省委列出来的15项专项治理问题，深入开展自查自纠，一项项明确任务书、时间表、责任人，一项项整改到位。<br><br>

　　徐守盛强调，组织观看党内教育参考片《苏联亡党亡国20年祭――俄罗斯人在诉说》，是教育实践活动的一项重要内容，对于广大党员干部具有很强的警示教育作用。理想信念这个“钙”，任何时候都缺失不得；密切联系群众这个优良传统，任何时候都丢弃不得；保持党员队伍的先进性、纯洁性，任何时候都忽视不得。全省各级党组织和广大党员、干部要进一步加强理论武装，廓清思想迷雾，排除思想干扰，坚定中国特色社会主义道路自信、理论自信、制度自信，毫不动摇坚持、与时俱进发展中国特色社会主义。要加强中国特色社会主义理论体系学习教育，认真学习和深刻领会实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦这一重大战略思想，加强社会主义核心价值体系建设，巩固壮大主流思想舆论，使主流思想紧紧掌握在党和人民手里。要把作风建设摆在更加突出的位置，牢固树立为人民服务的根本宗旨，时刻不忘密切党群、干群关系，一以贯之转变工作作风，始终高举反腐倡廉大旗。要以开展教育实践活动为契机，坚持党要管党、从严治党，不断提高党的领导水平和执政水平，坚持正确用人导向，坚持民主集中制，加强基层党组织建设和党员、干部管理。<br><br>

　　省委常委中心组成员、在职省级领导、第一批教育实践活动单位主要负责人等参加集中学习。<br><br>

陈独秀6个子女今何在？ <br><br>
 
2010年11月23日  中国共产党新闻网 <br><br>
陈独秀共有6个子女，即长子陈延年、次子陈乔年、三子陈松年、四子陈鹤年（后改名陈哲民）、长女陈玉莹、次女陈子美（其中，延年、乔年、松年、玉莹为陈独秀和结发妻子高晓岚所生，鹤年、子美为陈独秀与高曼君所生）。这6个子女，大都走上了献身革命、自立自强的道路，其中，陈延年和陈乔年，同是中共早期领导人，在革命斗争中壮烈牺牲，为中国人民的解放事业做出了巨大贡献。他们之所以能够献身革命、自立自强，是与陈独秀的教子有方分不开的。<br><br>

　　疼爱而不溺爱，陈延年、陈乔年兄弟死于国民党手中<br><br>

　　长子陈延年<br><br>

　　同天下所有父母一样，陈独秀对自己的子女非常疼爱。但是，陈独秀常年为革命奔走，公而忘私，无暇顾及家庭子女，不仅未能在家庭生活上给子女带来幸福，反而还曾因他从事革命活动而连累了家人，危及子女的生命安全。在讨伐袁世凯的“二次革命”失败后，安徽都督柏文蔚、都督府秘书长陈独秀被袁世凯的爪牙倪嗣冲通缉。由于柏文蔚、陈独秀迅速逃往上海，倪嗣冲没有抓到他们，便对陈独秀在安庆的家人进行迫害。他们将魔爪伸向陈独秀的两个尚未成年的儿子延年和乔年，并扬言要斩草除根。幸好陈家事先得到了消息，让延年和乔年去乡间躲避，倪嗣冲才未能得逞。延年和乔年在乡间躲了一段时间之后又回到了安庆。随着年龄的增长，兄弟俩越来越感到，在安庆这个小地方，已经学不到更多的知识了，他们渴望外出求学。他们的这一愿望和志向得到了祖母和母亲的默许。<br><br>

　　1915年夏天，陈独秀从日本返回上海，开始筹办《新青年》杂志之事。就在这时，他接到了安庆老家的来信，得知延年、乔年兄弟俩想出来读书的消息。陈独秀感到儿子已经长大，应当让他们出来闯一闯。因此，他对延年、乔年兄弟俩的想法表示赞成，并回信让他们立即到上海来。<br><br>

　　于是，兄弟俩辞别母亲和祖母，乘舟东下，于1915年冬天抵达上海。那时延年17岁，而乔年才13岁。兄弟俩初到上海时，一度与父亲住在一起。然而，没过多久，他们就从父亲住处搬出，寄宿于《新青年》杂志发行所店堂，白天在外工作，谋生自给，晚上则去法国巡捕房附设的法语学校学习法文，过着半工半读的生活。当时，陈独秀虽然已闻名全国，但收入却不多，每月给兄弟俩的钱为数很少，只能维持他们最低的生活水平，剩下的开支全由兄弟俩自己谋取。平时，延年兄弟俩只能“食则侉饼，饮则自来水”。由于生活艰苦，“故颜色憔枯，人多惜之”。<br><br>

　　对延年兄弟俩的生活状况，旁人都以为太苦，常表怜悯之意，但他们自己却处之泰然，毫无怨言，有意识地要在艰苦环境中磨炼自己。作为父亲，陈独秀也支持孩子们在艰难困苦的环境中自创前程，让他们更好地成长起来，将来成为有用之材。这让既是姨母又是继母的高君曼十分心疼。她曾数次苦劝陈独秀让孩子们回家食住，还通过陈独秀的老友潘赞化代为恳求陈独秀，但陈独秀总不以为然，说那样姑息养奸，不可！他以为高君曼“妇人之仁，徒贼子弟，虽是善意，反生恶果，少年人生，听他自创前途可也”。<br><br>
陈延年、陈乔年兄弟俩没有辜负陈独秀的良苦用心。他们在艰苦的条件下，勤奋学习，自立自强，后来一起考进了震旦大学。1920年2月初，他们又一起到法国勤工俭学。对于延年、乔年出国留学的愿望，陈独秀完全赞成，并劝过兄弟俩去苏俄留学。可是延年、乔年当时由于受到无政府主义思想影响，对苏俄有些反感，坚持要去法国。他们在法国期间，逐渐了解和接受了马克思主义，对一度信仰的无政府主义产生了怀疑，最终同无政府主义决裂，转而信仰马克思主义。此后，延年和乔年先后参加了旅欧共产主义组织――中国少年共产党和法国共产党。1922年冬，兄弟俩又一起转为中国共产党党员。1923年初，遵照中共中央的指示，延年、乔年兄弟俩及赵世炎、王若飞等12人离开法国到苏联学习。4月中旬，他们抵达莫斯科，进入“东方劳动者共产主义大学”和“东方大学”学习。在莫斯科期间，兄弟俩更加系统地学习和研究了马克思主义的基本理论，研究了俄国革命和国际共产主义运动的经验，终于成为坚定的共产主义战士。<br><br>

　　1924年夏天，由于国内革命工作需要，陈延年奉调回国。两个月后，他返回阔别了4年多的上海，并与当时在上海的父亲陈独秀团聚。陈延年回国后，中共中央立即讨论了他的工作问题。作为党的最高领导人的陈独秀，并没有将自己的儿子留在中央机关，留在自己身边。而同过去一样，他希望延年到大风大浪中去锻炼。因此，陈延年很快被派往当时革命的中心和阶级斗争极为尖锐复杂的广东去工作。<br><br>

　　到广东之初，陈延年负责广东社会主义青年团的工作。1924年底、1925年初，他接替周恩来，任中共广东区委书记，直到1927年3月奉命离开广东。在此期间，他和周恩来、彭湃、毛泽东等人一起，领导了广东的工人运动、农民运动、青年运动和统战工作，并将起初只有几百名党员的广东党组织发展成为拥有数千名党员、领导数百万工农群众进行革命斗争的领导核心。他在广东最突出的功绩是成功地领导了震惊中外的省港大罢工。毛泽东当时就称赞他是“党内不可多得的人才”，还有人称他是“共产党中的两广王”。特别难能可贵的是，陈延年对陈独秀在大革命后期的右倾机会主义错误，坚持独立思考，从实际出发，决不盲从。他曾多次在中共广东区委会议上说：“我和老头子是父子关系，但我是共产党员，我坚决反对妥协退让的右倾机会主义错误。”他的鲜明态度和坚持原则的精神得到了大家的支持和称赞。<br><br>

　　1927年3月，陈延年率中共五大广东代表团离开广州，北上武汉，准备出席党的五大。可是刚到武汉不久，在武汉的中共中央领导人就决定派他和李立三、聂荣臻等人火速赶往上海，传达中央关于开展反蒋斗争的指示。他们刚到南京，便获悉蒋介石在上海发动了四一二反革命政变。到上海后，陈延年接替罗亦农担任中共江浙区委书记。他虽因工作需要未能出席中共五大，但仍被大会选为党的第五届中央委员和政治局候补委员。<br><br>

　　陈延年担任中共江浙区委书记时，可谓受命于危难之际。四一二政变后，大批优秀的共产党员惨遭杀害。面对如此险恶的形势，陈延年毫不畏惧，勇敢地承担起重整党组织的重任。他与担任区委组织部长的赵世炎一起，开始为恢复被摧残的党和工会组织日夜奔忙。陈延年在上海工作的时间并不长，1927年6月下旬，他就因叛徒出卖而被捕了。反共头目吴稚晖听说陈延年被捕，欣喜若狂地大叫：“好了！好了！老陈（指陈独秀）没有用，小陈可怕；捉到小陈，天下从此太平了。”他一面报告蒋介石，一面立即给当时的上海警备司令杨虎发了一封所谓的“贺函”。杨虎立即下令严加审讯。面对凶残的敌人，陈延年毫不畏惧。敌人用尽酷刑，也没能从他嘴里掏出任何需要的东西，只好将他杀害来泄愤。1927年7月4日深夜，国民党反动派将陈延年秘密处死。陈延年在牺牲的时候非常壮烈，当敌人要他下跪时，他直立不屈，并高呼口号，虽然几个执刑的士兵用力将他按住，但当刽子手松手挥刀时，他突然一跃而起，遂被按在地上用乱刀砍死。陈延年牺牲时，年仅29岁。面对死亡，他仍如此坚强，宁死不屈、视死如归的精神和气概，真可谓惊天地、泣鬼神！当陈独秀得知自己的长子被害的消息之后，一连好几天不说一句话，把悲痛深深地埋在心里，默默承受着丧子之痛。<br><br>

　　次子陈乔年<br><br>
陈乔年于1925年春接到中共中央的指示回国工作。他一到北京，就被任命为中共北方区委组织部长，与担任区委书记的李大钊一起工作。在这一时期，他积极参与中共北方区委的重大决策，并同李大钊、赵世炎等人一起，为发动各界群众与北洋军阀政府斗争作了大量的宣传和组织工作，使北方地区的革命运动出现了一个又一个高潮。<br><br>

　　1926年下半年，陈乔年离京南下，并在上海工作了一段时间。在1927年4月召开的五大上，陈乔年和他的父亲陈独秀、胞兄陈延年一起当选为中央委员。父子三人同时进入中共中央委员会，这在中共历史上是绝无仅有的。<br><br>

　　党的五大结束后，根据中共中央决定，陈乔年留在武汉，任中共中央组织部副部长，并代理部长李维汉主持中央组织部的工作。作为中央委员，陈乔年出席了党的八七会议，并表示完全拥护会议对自己父亲的错误所作的批评，拥护党确定的新的方针政策。八七会议后，陈乔年改任中共湖北省委组织部长。不久，又回到上海，任中共江苏省委组织部长。1928年2月16日，由于叛徒告密，陈乔年在开会时被捕。从被捕的第一天起，陈乔年就清楚地知道，由于他担任了党的重要职务，又是陈独秀的儿子，必死无疑。他将生死置之度外，没有丝毫畏惧，也没有任何懊丧。他所考虑的，只是如何继续同敌人作斗争。当他的身份暴露后，他从狱中托人转告党组织，请求党不要再为营救他费心和花钱，同时继续在狱中同敌人进行英勇的斗争。<br><br>

　　1928年6月6日，陈乔年在龙华的枫林桥畔，洒尽了最后一滴血，时年仅26岁。<br><br>

　　陈独秀得知自己的又一个儿子惨死在国民党的屠刀下后，极其悲痛。这个性格刚强的硬汉子，默默地流下了眼泪。<br><br>

　　陈延年、陈乔年牺牲的消息，远在安庆老家的高晓岚并不知道。她一直为他们两个的安危担忧。为了打听他们的消息，她让长女陈玉莹来到上海。不料，陈玉莹到上海得知哥哥延年和弟弟乔年都已牺牲的消息后，由于伤心过度，一病不起。就在乔年牺牲的同一年，玉莹也病死在上海宝龙医院。在不到两年的时间里，三个亲生骨肉接二连三地惨死，作为父亲的陈独秀，其万分悲伤的心情是可想而知的。<br><br>

 三子陈松年窑厂工作30年，1980年退休<br><br>

　　陈独秀一生中，曾于1919年6月11日、1921年10月4日、1922年8月9日、1932年10月15日四次被捕，先后坐过北洋军阀政府、上海法租界巡捕房和国民党政府的监狱。陈独秀不畏惧坐牢，在狱中，始终保持着昂扬正气，铮铮铁骨，不向敌人屈膝投降。陈独秀言语不多，不善辞令，但他的一身正气和硬骨头精神却深深影响了自己的子女。<br><br>

　　陈独秀第四次被捕后，国民党最高法院于1933年6月底以所谓“进行叛国的文字宣传”之罪名，判处陈独秀有期徒刑8年。随即，陈独秀被关进南京第一模范监狱（又名老虎桥监狱）。之后，他的三子陈松年、四子陈鹤年、女儿陈子美都曾去监狱探望。<br><br>

　　陈松年第一次去南京探监时，由于终于见到了朝思暮想的父亲，悲喜交加，激动得一时竟不知说什么好，唯有伤心落泪。这时，陈独秀不但没有安慰他，反而严厉训斥他。陈独秀对这个多年不见的儿子所讲的第一句话是：“没出息！”<br><br>

　　在一般人看来，陈独秀这样做似乎不近人情，其实，这正是他与众不同之处。自献身革命以来，他虽犯过不少错误，走过不少弯路，但有一点却是始终不变的，那就是从不向恶势力低头，从不因处境艰难而悲观失望。自身如此，他当然也不希望自己的儿子表现得过于懦弱，看到儿子伤心落泪，便免不了加以训斥。以前，陈松年虽然多次听祖母、母亲及其他人说过父亲的倔强脾气、坚强性格，却从未直接感受过。这一次，他总算亲自领教了父亲的厉害，而且印象至深，永世难忘。后来，陈松年同父亲接触多了，耳濡目染，学到不少东西。他虽然没有像父亲那样经历过大风大浪，但在自己的一生中，也遇到了不少艰难曲折，每次他都能像父亲一样，刚正不阿，泰然处之。陈松年常对自己的子女说，人要知足常乐，遇事要想得开。还说，人生在世，一定要踏踏实实做事，清清白白做人。陈松年曾做过小学教员、中学教员。在抗战时期，又随父亲到达武汉、重庆、四川江津，饱经战乱之苦。1942年5月陈独秀病逝江津后，他妥善地料理了父亲的后事。1947年又将父亲的灵柩由四川移至安庆市郊安葬。1949年春天安庆解放后，陈松年起初在街道义务帮助做行政工作。后来，街道办了工厂，他就选择到又脏又累的窑厂工作，一干就是30多年，从未调动过，直到1980年退休。<br><br>

　　 
四子陈鹤年 在香港创办进步杂志<br><br>

　　陈独秀的四子陈鹤年第一次到南京监狱去看父亲时，天真地提出要想办法帮助陈独秀越狱逃跑。陈独秀不但不赞成，反而将他骂了一顿，说他“胡闹”。<br><br>

　　不过，骂归骂，陈独秀对儿子的这片孝心还是感到满意的。陈鹤年也没有因为挨骂而对父亲不满，以后仍经常去看父亲，并尽力帮助父亲。陈独秀在狱中写的《自撰辩诉状》，就是由陈鹤年拿到《民声报》去秘密印刷后，在社会上散发的。<br><br>

　　陈鹤年在父亲的影响下，后来也走上了自立自强的道路。他于1934年考进了扬州中学高中班，未毕业又转到北平，进入北平致诚中学，在这里完成了高中学业。之后，他考进了北平法商学院。一二九运动之后，陈鹤年加入了“民先队”和中国共产党，经常到工农群众中去进行抗日宣传，是北平著名的学生领袖之一。卢沟桥事变后，陈鹤年留在北平，继续进行秘密斗争。1938年秋天，他的身份暴露，不得不立即转移。于是他经天津、上海去香港，想再从香港设法去延安。但是，离开北平后，陈鹤年就同党组织断了联系，而且以后再也没有接上，关系一断，要去延安就很困难了。在港期间，陈鹤年先后在香港《立报》、《时代评论》、《星岛日报》等报刊社工作过。后来，他自己创办了一个杂志，最初叫《少年文艺》，主要是通过讲故事的形式，宣传中国共产党领导的革命。这个杂志受到反共的港英当局的查禁，陈鹤年遂将刊名改为《新少年》，继续出版，名称虽变，宗旨未改。他办杂志，不是为了赚钱，而是为了对社会做出贡献，为了教育和培养青少年。为将杂志坚持办下去，他不但花费了大量的精力，还把自己收入的一大部分贴了进去。<br><br>

　　女儿陈子美　定居加拿大<br><br>

　　陈独秀的女儿陈子美，生于1912年。由于陈独秀投身革命，东奔西走，终日生活在动荡不定之中，陈子美的童年和少年时代饱受颠沛流离之苦。这种经历对她的成长产生了很大影响。陈子美的性格也像陈独秀一样倔强独立，敢作敢为。她在抗战爆发前学习过收发电报的技术，在杭州电信局工作过。抗日战争爆发后，陈子美和她的第一任丈夫失了业，在泰州、上海、南京之间靠“跑单帮”维持生活，还学习过妇产科的接生技术。上海解放后，她当上了里弄的“接生员”。第二次结婚后，又随丈夫由上海定居广州。在“文化大革命”中，陈子美受到残酷迫害，吃尽了苦头。她不甘屈辱，在忍无可忍的情况下，便同两个儿子一起由广州逃到香港，后来又去了加拿大定居。<br><br>

这里首先需要说明的是，戈尔巴乔夫所说的“改革”，在俄文中的原意为“改造”、“重建”等。戈尔巴乔夫领导集团所竭力推行的改革与我国新时期所进行的改革有着本质和方向上的不同。为与我国现行的译法相衔接，本片仍延用此译法，只是提请观众注意其特指性。<br><br>

以毛泽东为核心的中国共产党的第一代中央领导集体，高度关注苏共的蜕化变质，并高瞻远瞩地预言到其可能亡党亡国的悲惨结果。以邓小平、江泽民为核心的中国共产党的第二、第三代中央领导集体和以胡锦涛为总书记的党中央高度重视对苏联亡党亡国原因与教训的研究，并有着不少相关精辟论述。<br><br>

2011年也是中国共产党成立90周年。认真研究、正确认识苏联亡党亡国这一重大事件，对于进一步加强中国共产党的先进性建设，不断推进中国特色社会主义宏伟大业，具有十分重要的意义。<br><br>

 

序 世纪大悲剧<br><br>

莫斯科，红场。这里，曾是世界上第一个社会主义国家的象征，曾是国际共产主义运动一面鲜红的旗帜，曾是一个伟大国家和伟大人民的骄傲。<br><br>

红墙和广场，像位历史老人，见证了列宁和斯大林等苏联共产党人亲手缔造的红色政权和艰辛开创的社会主义事业发展和壮大，见证了那个时代的辉煌和那个辉煌的时代。<br><br>

然而，它也见证了苏共和苏联一步步走向衰败，见证了飘扬在克里姆林宫上空70多年的红色旗帜，在亿万人民的叹息声中降落……<br><br>

如今，克里姆林宫的围墙依然泛着红色，列宁墓依然庄严肃穆，无名烈士墓依然圣火长明，但物是人非，留给人们的是无尽的感慨与深深的思索。<br><br>

1991年8月19日，以副总统亚纳耶夫为代表的苏联党政军最高领导人，为挽回苏联被瓦解的命运，阻止所谓“民主派”上台，经戈尔巴乔夫批准，事先成立的“国家紧急状态委员会，，即宣布在一些地区实行为期六个月的“紧急状态”，这就是震惊世界的“8.19”事件。<br><br>

“8.19"事件后，叶利钦即签署《关于中止苏共和俄共在俄罗斯联邦领土上活动》的总统令，查封了苏共中央办公大楼。<br><br>

12月25日，戈尔巴乔夫发表电视讲话，声明辞去总统职务。<br><br>

12月26日，苏联最高苏维埃举行最后一次会议，宣布苏联停止存在。苏联就此从世界地图上消失。<br><br>

西方世界为此欢呼雀跃，认为社会主义的历史从此终结，而资本主义制度及其价值观念一劳永逸地取得了胜利。具有讽刺意味的是，此前一天正是西方人的圣诞节。<br><br>

美国总统克林顿1995年10月在参谋长联席会议上说：“最近10年来对苏联及其盟友的政策清楚表明，我们所采取的清除世界上最强大的国家之一以及最强大军事联盟的路线是多么正确。我们获得了杜鲁门总统想要通过原子弹从苏联获取的东西。”<br><br>

苏联亡党亡国，是世界社会主义运动中的大逆流、大灾难，人类历史发展与人类进步事业遭遇重大的挫折。<br><br>

苏联亡党亡国，首先给前苏联各国人民带来巨大的灾难。<br><br>

1999年12月31日，刚刚代理俄罗斯总统职务的普京在《千年之交的俄罗斯》的演说中指出：“俄罗斯正处于数百年来最困难的一个历史时期。大概这是俄罗斯近200-300年来首次真正面临沦为世界二流国家、抑或三流国家的危险。”<br><br>

2005年，俄罗斯总统普京发表年度国情咨文时又十分痛心地说：“苏联的解体，是20世纪最严重的地缘政治灾难;对于绝大多数俄罗斯人民来讲，它是一场真正的悲剧”。(3)<br><br>

20年过去了，许多俄罗斯人谈到苏联解体时无不痛心疾首。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、社会政治研究所所长根・瓦・奥希波夫：“苏联的解体是一个巨大历史悲剧，是20世纪乃至影响到21世纪的巨大政治灾难。”<br><br>

某养鱼场总经理瓦西里・伊万诺维奇：“当听到苏联解体消息的时候，我们心里感到非常痛苦。一夜醒来，我们的国家已经是另外一个国家了。”<br><br>

俄中友协主席、俄罗斯科学院院士米咧・季塔连科：“苏联解体是20世纪最大的悲剧之一。这可以从很多角度看。从文明角度看，这是文明的倒退，也是整个世界的倒退。这给居住在苏联境内的各民族带来巨大的苦难，使这些民族的发展进程倒退了几十年。”<br><br>

俄罗斯联邦共产党中央委员会主席根・安・久加诺夫：“苏联的解体给世界造成了很严重的灾难，让全世界失衡了，苏联解体使我们在1945年5月取得的胜利所建立的平衡又失去了。对于苏联人民来说，这是严重的灾难。这场使苏联人民经历的严重内伤，直到现在还没有痊愈。”<br><br>

据统计，从1991年苏联解体到20世纪末，俄罗斯国内生产总值比1990年下降了52%，而1941―1945年的卫国战争期间仅仅下降22%;同期工业生产减少了64.5%，农业生产减少了60.4%;卢布贬值，物价飞涨6000多倍。<br><br>

美国前总统克林顿公开宣称：“俄罗斯人必须抛弃过去的帝国思维，俄罗斯已不再是世界大国，而只是非洲的上沃尔特”(4)。上沃尔特即布基纳法索，面积27.4万平方公里，是位于非洲西部的内陆国，2009年的GDP仅有81.05亿美元。这一判定当然言过其实，但从一定程度上反映了俄罗斯的衰落和西方对俄罗斯的轻慢。
<br><br>
此时的布热津斯基几乎是用命令、轻蔑和挖苦的口吻教训俄国人说：“对美国来说，俄国实在太虚弱了，不配成为伙伴;但如果只是作为美国的病人，俄国又太强壮了。”(5)<br><br>

1994年，俄罗斯著名作家、原持不同政见者马克西莫夫去世前躺在病床上对《真理报》记者谈到：“我从来没有想过我会对现在发生的一切感到如此痛心”，自己的祖国被糟蹋成这个样子，好像“眼睁睁地看着自己的母亲被强奸一样。再没有比这更难受的了”。(6)<br><br>

苏联亡党亡国，给世界社会主义运动的发展造成极大的挫折。<br><br>

苏东剧变，致使原有的15个社会主义国家中的多数国家改变社会主义性质。原苏联分裂出15个独立国家，由铁托元帅亲手建立起来的“南斯拉夫联邦，，如今一分为六，捷克斯洛伐克也被一分为二。世界土除中国共产党等几个执政的共产党夕卜，各国共产党员的总人数由原来的4400多万锐减为1000多万，且绝大多数党在本国影响不大。伴随着共产党执政地位的丧失，东欧各国普遍政治上实行以多党制为基础的资产阶级民主，经济上大肆推行私有化。与此相伴的是，社会生产大幅度下滑，通货膨胀严重，失业率居高不下，人民实际生活水平大幅下降。广大人民为之付出的沉重代价远远超出事先的想象。<br><br>

2011年10月，俄中友协主席、俄罗斯科学院院士季塔连科院士在俄会见中国哲学社会科学家赴俄考察团时说：“苏联解体后至今，除哈萨克斯坦仅仅恢复到解体前的1989年生活水平外，前苏联所有加盟共和国都没有达到苏联时期的生活水平。俄罗斯迄今为止有30%的公民生活在贫困线以下。”2011年12月27日，日本《朝日新闻》发表纪念苏联解体20周年的社论指出：当年“戈尔巴乔夫总统在辞职时说：‘各民族将繁荣昌盛……’然而20年后的今天，独立出来的诸国中几乎没有国家实现这个预言。”(7)原来凭借与经互会的关系发展势头较好的古巴、朝鲜也遭受前所未有的打击。古巴1993年人均GDP仅为1989年的66%”，(8)2008年，时任古巴最高领导人卡斯特罗说：时至今日，古巴仍未从苏联解体这一打击中走出来。而苏东剧变后朝鲜经济则是连续9年出现年均约2%的负增长。(9)<br><br>

苏联亡党亡国，给广大发展中国家和发达国家的人民同样也造成严重灾难。<br><br>

冷战结束后，以美国为首的西方强国凭借其在各方面的优势，鼓吹社会主义历史就此终结，并竭力贩卖新自由主义，主导新一轮经济全球化，对内放任资本对劳动的盘剥，对外拼命掠夺发展中国家的财富，导致全球范围内极少数富人越来越富，包括中等收入阶层在内的绝大多数人越来越穷，比尔・盖茨、沃伦・巴菲特、保罗・艾伦三人总资产比世界上最不发达的43个国家GDP的总量还多。同时也导致几乎所有国家主权债务都在急遽增多。全球范围内的生产社会化甚至生产全球化与生产资料私人占有之间、生产无限扩张与社会有限需求之间的根本矛盾进一步加剧。从一定意义上讲，2008年9月爆发至今尚未见底的国际金融危机这一巨大灾难也完全可以追溯到20年前的苏联亡党亡国。
<br><br>
苏联亡党亡国，严重地威胁着世界和平与发展的局面。<br><br>

冷战结束了，但世界没有进入一些人臆想的和平盛世，相反却步入了动荡的周期。短短二十年间，战乱和民族冲突不断，以美国为首的西方强国几乎没有停息地发动了波黑、科索沃、阿富汗、伊拉克和利比亚这五场较大规模的局部战争。<br><br>

以美国为首的西方世界还策动一场场所谓的“颜色革命”，在乌克兰、格鲁吉亚和中亚一些国家接二连三地上演，使得这些国家陷入或长期陷入动乱之中。<br><br>

基辛格明确指出：“他(赫鲁晓夫)在启动改革过程这方面，可谓是戈尔巴乔夫的祖师;改革的影响他并不了解，改革的方向却叫他追悔莫及。从这个角度来看，我们甚至可以说共产主义覆亡始于赫鲁晓夫。(10)<br><br>

倾听俄罗斯人的诉说，使我们更加感到：苏联亡党亡国这场世纪大悲剧的序幕完全可以追溯到赫鲁晓夫领导集团，但其直接进程则是始于戈尔巴乔夫领导集团执政之时。<br><br>

 

第一集 政治改革与多党制<br><br>

从1982年11月起在两年零四个月里，勃列日涅夫、安德罗波夫、契尔年科这三位苏联共产党总书记相继病逝。<br><br>

1985年3月11日，苏共中央召开非常全会，戈尔巴乔夫当选苏共中央总书记，成为苏共新一届最高领导人。<br><br>

他一上台即宣称要进行经济改革，实行“加速”战略。但由于缺乏正确的方向和有力的举措，不到两年时间，苏联的经济便陷入困境，人民生活开始恶化。<br><br>

1987年1月，苏共中央召开全会。戈尔巴乔夫提出要把苏联社会的“民主化”提到首位。1988年6月，苏共中央决定“根本改革政治体制”，改革重心由经济领域转向政治领域。<br><br>

1994年，戈尔巴乔夫改革的重要助手亚・尼・雅科夫列夫在回忆录中说：早在1985年12月，我就给戈尔巴乔夫写信，明确提出“民主化”就是要通过“公开性”等手段，结束苏共的“一党专制”，在苏联实现多党制和“三权分立”的资产阶级议会制。我“所讲的很多东西逐渐被采纳”(11)<br><br>

原苏共中央意识形态部部长亚・谢・卡普托：“在1988年就能明显地看出，在苏共中央内部，有很大一部分中央委员是反对戈尔巴乔夫改革政策的。戈尔巴乔夫以年龄过高等为借口，开列了150人的所谓反对派名单，在一次中央全会上把他们清除了出去。党章是不允许这么做的，因为这些苏共中央的委员是由党的全国代表大会选举产生的。当时150人清单中就有苏联外长葛罗米柯。”<br><br>

在半年多的时间里，戈尔巴乔夫迅速剥夺了党内坚持党的原则的“元老派”的权力，把亲西方的谢瓦尔德纳泽、雅科夫列夫等人拉进苏共中央最高领导层，对各级干部包括军队领导人进行了大幅度撤换或调整。到1986年2月，15个加盟共和国党中央、最高苏维埃、部长会议的主要领导人更换了19人，(12)40%以上的中央委员是新人(13)。到1988年初，所有部长、中央机关的部门领导、各委员会负责人遭替换、开除或数次调换岗位，干部变动率超过100%。(14)<br><br>

为了向国内外塑造自己所谓“公开”、“民主”的形象，戈尔巴乔夫甚至不加区别地要求电视直播党和国家的高层各种会议，这致使苏共高层之间的矛盾公开化，加剧了苏共内部的分歧。<br><br>

原苏共中央意识形态部部长亚・谢・卡普托：“在党的队伍中很快分成了两派，一部分是所谓传统‘保守派’，另外一部分是所谓改革‘民主派’。其实这是一种很狡猾、很圆滑的说法。对戈尔巴乔夫有异议、持批判态度的，报刊等媒体就把他们打到‘保守派’，当中去;只要支持戈尔巴乔夫的做法，哪怕他的观点全是错误的，马上就被封为改革的‘民主派’。党的队伍中的两派开始对立起来。这一矛盾逐渐在全国蔓延开来。”<br><br>

1986年底，在高尔基城被流放了六年的著名持不同政见者萨哈罗夫回到了莫斯科。<br><br>

现场记录：<br><br>

记者：“是谁给你打的电话，是不是戈尔巴乔夫?”<br><br>

萨哈洛夫：“是，他突然打来电话，说作了一个决议，你可以回到莫斯科。”<br><br>

这是戈尔巴乔夫为给自己的改革营造社会政治基础，同时打压党内健康力量，向苏联境内公开崇尚西方民主的反共反社会主义分子伸出的橄榄枝。<br><br>

萨哈罗夫：“我希望我会获得全部的人身自由，我以后尽我的力量做一些事，这是我的使命。”<br><br>

重返政治舞台的萨哈罗夫积极从事反共反苏的种种活动，并迅速成为所谓“民主派”的领头羊。<br><br>

在“民主化”、“公开性”的浪潮中，1986年苏联开始出现各种“非正式组织”。这些组织是以各种“辩论会”、“俱乐部”、“知识分子小组”和“青年小组”等面目出现，时而隐蔽，时而公开。1987年蔓延到全苏很多大中城市，当年底就发展到3万余个，1989年增至9万多个。<br><br>

这些“非正式组织”中的绝大多数是有政治目标的组织。有的打着维护所谓本民族利益旗号谋求脱离苏联而独立，有的崇拜西方民主主张全盘西化，有的还要求复辟沙皇专制统治，等等。而打着资产阶级“民主”和“人道主义”旗号的组织尤为活跃。<br><br>

“非正式组织”活动猖獗，各种反党反社会主义的集会、游行、示威、罢工、罢课以至民族冲突此伏彼起，连绵不绝。<br><br>

面对严重威胁党和社会主义政权以及社会稳定的“非正式组织”及其活动，戈尔巴乔夫听之任之，不久便大加赞赏。<br><br>

1988年6月28日，苏共第十九次全国代表会议全面拉开了政治改革的大幕。<br><br>

此次会议把“人道的民主的社会主义”确立为改革的“最终目标和理想”。戈尔巴乔夫还以区分党的机关和国家机关的职能为名，强调苏共只通过自己的党员贯彻执行自己的政治方针”(15)，试图放弃苏共对国家权力机关和行政机关的领导权。<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫后来坦言：进行政治改革的目的就是把权力从共产党的手中转到人民代表苏维埃的手中，就是把苏联人代会改造成为允许反对派进入并自由发表意见的西方式的议会。(16)<br><br>

政治嗅觉灵敏的美国前驻苏联大使马特洛克，是这样回忆他当时翻阅代表会议文件时的感受：“新内容比比皆是，我兴奋不已”;除了“社会主义，，这个词外，与《共产党宣言》甚至与《资本论》几乎没有一点联系，而更接近于欧洲民主。如果文件所言能够实现，共产党“一党专政”将很快寿终正寝。(17)<br><br>

1989年春，全苏人民代表选举开始。这是戈尔巴乔夫效仿西方议会制，在苏联举行的第一次全民选举。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、俄罗斯国立社会大学校长瓦・伊・茹科夫：“到召开苏联第一次人民代表大会的时候，无论是在首都还是在外地，共产党在选举中都失败了。后来参加选举包括选举取胜的那些人，都是放弃了社会主义和共产主义信仰的人。”<br><br>

选举过程一片混乱。许多不称职的人，甚至连杀人坐牢的恶性罪犯也出现在人民代表的候选人中。而那些反苏反共的空谈家和蛊惑人心者，更是数不胜数。<br><br>

反苏反共反社会主义的势力纷纷组织起来，频频发表竞选演说，组织各种群众集会，声援自己的候选人。<br><br>

而戈尔巴乔夫却要求苏共在选举中与选举保持距离，命令党组织不得干预其候选人的活动。<br><br>

波罗的海三国分裂势力的代表人物和积极分子纷纷当选。苏共内部著名的反对派人物叶利钦也在莫斯科高票当选。起初在苏联科学院落选的萨哈罗夫，在戈尔巴乔夫特别关照下入选。<br><br>

与此形成鲜明对照的是，160名党委第一书记中有32名落选。在列宁格勒，市、州两级党和苏维埃领导人以及州党委委员没有一名当选。全苏16个军区有14个军区司令员铩羽而归。<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫却吹嘘公开性取得了选举的胜利。他后来坦言：为达到把权力从共产党手中转交到人民代表苏维埃手中，就必须允许和鼓励反对派进入权力体系参与“改革”，同时藉此孤立和打压苏共内部“最保守的部分”(18)。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、俄罗斯国立社会大学校长瓦・伊・茹科夫：“当时党的领导人没有及时利用良好的机会，让赞成共产主义理想并拥护社会主义制度的人当选。普通的党员无可奈何，他们的声音很微弱，人们听不到他们的声音。”<br><br>

1989年5月25日，苏联第一次人民代表大会召开。电视和广播现场直播，辩论的场面一浪高过一浪。<br><br>

大会选举了最高苏维埃主席、第一副主席、最高苏维埃成员等。当时持自由派观点的代表波奇诺克是这样描述那场选举的。<br><br>

俄罗斯联邦前劳动和社会发展部部长亚・彼・波奇诺克：“在选举中要战胜苏共，并不是一件很困难的事情。苏联共产党筹备人民代表大会选举包括最高苏维埃选举时采取的措施显得那么笨拙、粗糙。”<br><br>

有近15%的“民主派”及其支持者进入最高苏维埃。叶利钦侥幸靠递补当选。戈尔巴乔夫当选最高苏维埃主席。<br><br>

会上，萨哈罗夫率先提议取消明文规定“苏共领导地位”的苏联宪法第六条。叶利钦当即附议赞成，但因大多数代表坚决反对而作罢。<br><br>

人民代表大会后不久，1989年7月，全苏第一次跨地区议员团代表会议在莫斯科的电影之家召开，与会者包括波罗的海沿岸几个共和国代表在内的240多名“民主派”人民代表。<br><br>

叶利钦、波波夫、萨哈罗夫、阿法纳西耶夫等一些所谓民主派的头面人物当选轮值主席。在苏联最高权力机构第一次出现了正式的反对派组织。他们首要推动的是要取消宪法第六条。<br><br>

原苏共中央政治局委员、苏联部长会议主席尼・伊・雷日科夫：“他们无所不用其极，目的就是让国家的局势变坏，给中央政权脸上抹黑，以此来证明，他们代表的才是新的、进步的思想。”<br><br>

“跨地区议员团”还接过戈尔巴乔夫“一切权力归苏维埃”的口号，要求苏共交权。<br><br>

原苏共中央政治局委员、苏联部长会议主席尼・伊・雷日科夫：“我记得很清楚，有萨哈罗夫的一些照片。如果有必要，可以在网上找到这些照片。他脖子上戴着一个硬纸板，上面写着：‘一切权力归苏维埃’。”<br><br>

1989年12月12日，第二次苏联人民代表大会召开。萨哈罗夫代表跨地区议员团再次提议取消宪法第六条。<br><br>

萨哈罗夫发言同期声：“根据权力分立的原则，人民代表大会应作出以下决议：一、取消苏联宪法第六条;二、改变苏联法律制度。苏联的法律如果要在加盟共和国境内生效，就必须经加盟共和国最高立法机构批准。”<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫：“我提议对宪法第六条的动议进行表决，请各位代表进行表决。是赞成，是反对，是弃权。”<br><br>

投票的结果是这项提议仍没有被列入大会议程，但得到超过1/3的支持票。<br><br>

两天后，萨哈罗夫突发心脏病去世。所谓“民主派”知识分子借机将葬礼演变成一场政治示威。<br><br>

面对“民主派”掀起的修宪狂潮，戈尔巴乔夫最终决定迎合。<br><br>

1989年11月26日，戈尔巴乔夫撰文赞赏西方议会民主，宣扬效仿西方式的三权分立。文章还提出，改革“必须根本改造我们的整个社会大厦，从经济基础到上层建筑。”(19)这是苏联领导人向社会乃至世界释放苏联准备搞西方民主制度的明确信号。<br><br>

1989年12月7日，立陶宛最高苏维埃修改了该共和国宪法第六条，取消了其中有关共产党领导地位的表述。一个月后，戈尔巴乔夫在立陶宛发表讲话：“我认为实行多党制并不是悲剧”，“我们不应该像魔鬼怕烧香那样害怕多党制”。<br><br>

1990年2月4日，苏共中央召开全会前一天，“民主派”在莫斯科动员了20万人集会游行，喊出了“取消苏共领导地位”、“审判苏共”、“实行多党制”等反动口号。<br><br>

2月5日，戈尔巴乔夫在中央全会上对上述公然的猖獗行为不仅在戈尔巴乔夫的推动下，3月11日，苏共中央全会决定向苏联人民代表大会提交修改宪法第六条等建议。<br><br>

三天后，第三次苏联(非常)人民代表大会正式通过修改宪法的法律。将其中第六条“苏联共产党是苏联社会的领导力量和指导力量，是苏联社会政治制度以及国家和社会组织的核心”(20)，改为“苏联共产党、其他政党以及工会、共青团、其他社会团体和运动通过自己选入人民代表苏维埃的代表并以其他形式参加制定苏维埃国家的政策，管理国家和社会事务”(21)。法律同时还规定，苏联公民有权结成政党。<br><br>

早在1936年，斯大林领导修订的苏联宪法首次明文规定，党是“劳动群众所有一切社会团体及国家机关的领导核心”。(22)<br><br>

这是苏联共产党长期执政的法律和政治保障。<br><br>

取消宪法第六条，对于苏共和苏联意味着什么呢?<br><br>

原苏共中央政治局委员叶・库・利加乔夫：“这是个大错误，这是毁灭性的开始。取消宪法第六条就是否定、取消党的领导。1991年苏维埃表决取消苏联。这是两个严重的错误。两次我都投了反对票。在1991年的会上，有200多人投了反对票。”<br><br>

原《真理报》主编、前杜马主席根・尼・谢列兹尼奥夫：“宪法第六条取消了，这就像一座大厦的顶梁柱被抽掉了一样，(国家这座)大厦也就倒塌了。”<br><br>

共产党是工人阶级的先锋队，是维护广大人民群众根本利益的集中代表。执政70多年的苏共自动放弃对国家的领导权力，这就为彻底背叛党的宗旨和广大人民群众的根本利益，实行多党制搬掉了根本障碍。<br><br>

党禁放开仅一年，联盟一级的政党就有约20个，共和国一级的政党竟多达500多个，其中绝大多数成为最终促使苏联亡党亡国的政治力量。<br><br>

在1990年的苏共中央二月全会上，戈尔巴乔夫还以多党制条件下国家不能出现权力真空为名建议设立总统职位，要求赋予总统一切必要的权力，以此确保他继续掌控苏联的最高领导权。<br><br>

不久，在戈尔巴乔夫的指使下，最高苏维埃通过实行总统制的决定。苏共中央三月全会决定推选戈尔巴乔夫为苏联总统候选人。从决定实行总统制到正式选出总统，前后不足40天。<br><br>

1990年3月15日，苏联第三次(非常)人民代表大会上，戈尔巴乔夫当选总统。这离他走上苏共最高领导职位整整五年，苏联的改革也走过五个春秋。<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫同期声：“我郑重宣誓：诚心为我国人民服务，严格遵守宪法，保障公民的权利和自由，衷心希望我能完成赋予我的苏联总统的崇高职责。”<br><br>

宪法同时也规定了总统对维护国家主权和领土完整的神圣职责。在苏联亡党亡国二十周年的今天，不少俄罗斯人在反思时追问，当年的戈尔巴乔夫履行了他的“郑重宣誓”了吗?!<br><br>

在这次苏联第三次(非常)人民代表大会上，哈萨克共和国领导人纳扎尔巴耶夫要求总统制同样适用于各加盟共和国并得到批准。不久，乌兹别克、哈萨克等共和国就选出了自己的总统。1991年7月10日，叶利钦宣誓就任俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国总统。从多党制、议会民主、三权分立到总统制，这完全实现了戈尔巴乔夫多年的夙愿和政治理想。<br><br>

而此时的戈尔巴乔夫总统将会把国家带向哪里呢?
<br><br>
街头议论的妇女：“戈尔巴乔夫当土总统后，国家就逐步走向分裂，他把国家彻底毁掉了。”<br><br>

俄罗斯社会大学克林分校纳・费，格里岑科教授：……当时由于实行总统制，苏联作为一个联盟制的国家，在很多(加盟共和国或)(自治)州都出现了以总统命名的职位，在苏联(中央)政权和(地方)总统政权之间产生了矛盾。”<br><br>

俄中友协主席、俄罗斯科学院院士米冽・季塔连科：“没有了国家的统一管理，纷纷说我是独立的，我有自己的想法，我有自己的总统。于是苏联成为世界土总统最多的国家。每个州、每个自治区共和国、每个加盟共和国甚至每一个民族都有自己的总统。”<br><br>

就在“民主派”通过选举苏联人民代表和最高苏维埃向苏共中央夺权的同时，他们还利用1990年初各地举行苏维埃选举之机夺取苏共各级地方政权，并且与民族分裂势力同流合污，疯狂进行分裂国家的活动。<br><br>

1990年3月11日，立陶宛率先宣布脱离苏联独立，拉脱维亚和爱沙尼亚紧随其后，拉开了解体苏联的序幕。<br><br>

1990年5月29日，叶利钦当选为俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃主席。6月12日，叶利钦集团主导的俄罗斯联邦人民代表大会通过主权宣言。7月10日，叶利钦宣誓就任俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国总统。这给予风雨飘摇中的联盟国家一记重击。此后其他共和国更是纷纷效仿。<br><br>

1990年7月，苏共举行了第二十八次代表大会。这是苏共历史上最后一次代表大会。此时苏共党内思想混乱、组织涣散、党派林立的状况已十分明显。<br><br>

莫斯科大学经济系教授亚・弗・布兹加林：“参加二十八大的有各式各样的代表，出现了一些观点不同的派别。”<br><br>

会上，各主要政治派别展开了激烈的交锋。以戈尔巴乔夫为首的主张民主社会主义的“苏共纲领派”成为会议的主流派别，决定着整个会议的精神和方向。以利加乔夫为代表的坚持社会主义原则的一些苏共高级干部被称为“传统派”，他们出于维护党内团结的良好愿望，在思想上做了“妥协”并支持戈尔巴乔夫继续担任党的总书记，但仍被戈氏集团排挤出中央委员会和政治局。而此时自觉翼羽丰满的“民主派”则决定与苏共彻底决裂。就在大会投票选举中央委员会之前，叶利钦突然宣布退出苏共。<br><br>

叶利钦同期声：“经过深思熟虑，我本想在二十八大之后退出苏共，但鉴于会上我被提名为中央委员，我不得不现在做出如下声明：我正式声明退出苏共，诚愿与各党派、社会团体进行协作。”<br><br>

随后，莫斯科市苏维埃王席波波夫和列宁格勒市苏维埃主席索布恰克等“民主派”人士也纷纷退出苏共。<br><br>

大会通过的决议表明，此时的苏共已经发生了完全的质变，蜕化为组织上“联邦化、松散化”、思想上完全奉行民主社会主义与资本主义意识形态的“俱乐部”。这是戈尔巴乔夫按照人道的民主社会主义路线改造苏共的必然结果。<br><br>

原苏共中央政治局委员叶，库・利加乔夫：“千万不能让野心家在党内建立宗派组织。然而，1990年党的代表大会报告讲：允许党内出现不同的派别。对于苏共来说，最重要的就是队伍的团结、统一。列宁在世时通过了关于加强党内团结的决议，规定党内不允许出现派别。出现宗派分子则立即开除出党。”<br><br>

随着多党制和总统制在苏联的确立，苏共领导苏联军队的地位开始发生根本的动摇。全苏第三次人代会通过的《关于设立苏联总统职位和苏联宪法(根本法)修改补充法》规定，苏联总统是苏联武装力量的最高统帅，有权任命和撤销军队高级指挥员。这就从法律上剥夺了苏共领导和指挥苏联军队的最高权力。<br><br>

军队“非政治化”、“非党化”舆论四起。渗透到军队的反苏反共势力配合社会上的“民主派”，利用苏联召开人代会之机不断攻击军队。社会上反军浪潮也十分狂烈，苏军被斥为“反改革的保守力量”、“保守势力的最后堡垒”。军内外的反共反社会主义势力相互勾结，要求改变苏军的性质和建军方向。而苏共的裂变，民族的分裂，进一步加剧了军队内部的混乱。军心涣散，军纪松弛，派系林立。到1991年8月，苏联军队形成五大派系，彼此争权夺利。<br><br>

人民对党、国家及军队的状况深深忧虑。<br><br>

1991年8月19日，震惊世界的“8.19”事件爆发。这是苏共内部一些力图挽救社会主义苏联的领导人为避免国家走向分裂所做的最后尝试。<br><br>

然而，在国外敌对势力的强力支持下，8月21日，叶利钦等所谓自由派势力控制了局势。<br><br>

苏联国防部决定撤回部署在实施紧急状态地区的部队。<br><br>

苏联军官国际联盟执委会主席叶・伊・科佩舍夫：“我走访过那些部队，当时只有少数的军队站在‘国家紧急状况委员会’一边，更多的人则无所谓。<br><br>

列宁曾说，党领导的红军比什么都重要。而此时被解除思想武装和党的坚强领导的苏联军队，面对站在坦克炮塔上的叶利钦阻止军队支持“国家紧急状态委员会”，面对反动势力疯狂摧毁苏共的组织、大肆迫害苏共党员时，除了束手看着自己长期捍卫的党和人民事业被葬送，还能做什么呢 <br><br>

曾任美军中将和美国国家安全局长的威廉・奥多姆指出：苏联“共产党同它们的将军们手挽手、肩并肩地走向灭亡”。(23)<br><br>

“8・19”事件后，戈尔巴乔夫利用总统职权并伙同叶利钦等所谓“民主派”疯狂迫害“8・19”事件的领导者、组织者和支持者。“国家紧急状态委员会”八名主要成员除内务部长普戈被捕前自杀外，其他成员都相继被捕或遭监禁。<br><br>

1991年8月22日，莫斯科举行大规模集会，庆祝叶利钦在“8.19” 事件中取得胜利。<br><br>

叶利钦同期声：“今天俄罗斯联邦决定，将三色旗作为国旗。”<br><br>

1991年8月23日，叶利钦在俄罗斯最高苏维埃会议上宣判了苏联共产党的命运。<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫同期声：我刚拿到事件当天的内阁会议记录，但我还没有看。<br><br>

叶利钦：就在这里读嘛。<br><br>

叶利钦：此时此刻我将签署总统令，停止俄罗斯共产党的活动。<br><br>

就这样，叶利钦以俄罗斯总统的名义，命令停止俄罗斯共产党的活动，禁止俄境内苏军党组织的活动，禁止苏国家安全委员会和内务部党组织的活动，下令查封苏共中央总部。<br><br>

8月24日，戈尔巴乔夫没有召开任何中央会议，就自行决定辞去苏共中央总书记，宣布苏共中央自行解散。<br><br>

同一天，苏军总参谋长阿赫罗梅耶夫元帅因悲愤绝望而自杀。<br><br>

当时担任苏共中央书记处书记的库普佐夫目睹了苏联共产党的最后时刻。<br><br>

原苏共中央书记处书记、前国家杜马副主席瓦・亚・库普佐夫：“23日白天，苏共中央书记处有五位书记被搜家。他们以此来吓唬我们，看我们能不能给他们什么证据。中午两点，我签署了一个决定，要求完整保存所有中央文件。他们从中午就开始往外轰人，到25号苏共中央就不存在了，我们只能通过电话互相联络。那时我在老广场办公大楼的三层，我的办公楼土面还有一个小阳台。我看到那些大学生还有那些受指使的人员。有一些外国使馆的车给他们送来吃的喝的。这些人都喝得醉醺醺的，干些完全发疯的事情。”<br><br>

更让库普佐夫感到屈辱的是他被赶出苏共中央办公大楼的那一刻。<br><br>

原苏共中央书记处书记、前国家杜马副主席瓦・亚・库普佐夫：“过了栏杆，进入一个100多米长的通道。两边挤满了人，有150多台摄像机在拍摄。我们路过的时候，他们纷纷向我们吐痰，侮辱我们。这是我人生经历的最屈辱的一刻。”<br><br>

拥有93年历史的苏联共产党就这样走完了它最后的时刻。
<br><br>
苏联解体后，许多共产党人遭到追捕。这位原立陶宛共产党中央主管意识形态问题的书记，现为共产党联盟一苏共理事会副主席的叶尔马拉维丘斯，就是被投进监狱的共产党人之一。<br><br>

原立陶宛共产党中央书记尤.尤・叶尔马拉维丘斯：“苏联解体以后，我们一直处于非法的状态，只能在一些比较隐蔽的地方躲避。1994年1月15日那天，我们被美国中央情报局在美国总统来访时非法绑架了，他们把我们带到了维尔纽斯――立陶宛首都。很明显，这些做法都不符合国际法，没有任何法律依据。我因为积极宣传共产党的主张，被判处八年有期徒刑。在维尔纽斯的监狱里还关押有不少教授。”<br><br>

与此同时，大批苏共党员和干部遭迫害。数以万计的苏共党员首先是党的机关的工作人员失业。仅莫斯科市就有6000多人;80%的苏军领导人和高级军官被撤换。其中有不少人的生活从此没有着落，流落街头，靠变卖家当甚至出售过去用鲜血换来的军功章维持起码的生计。<br><br>

亡党的结果就是亡国。“8・19”事件后，除此前已宣布独立的立陶宛、俄罗斯和格鲁吉亚外，原苏联其他加盟共和国纷纷宣布正式独立。12月16日，哈萨克斯坦最后宣布独立。至此，苏联，这个存在了69年的强大的联盟国家实质上已经消亡。<br><br>

 

第二集 经济改革与私有化<br><br>

这是苏联解体后俄罗斯成立的第一家证券交易所――莫斯科银行间外汇交易所。<br><br>

交易所的史料信息中心实际上就是俄罗斯的一座金融博物馆。这里浓缩着从沙皇帝国、苏联时期一直到今天的俄罗斯在经济领域历经的风风雨雨，陈列着一件件活生生的历史印证。<br><br>

这张面值为1万卢布的证券，不是一张普通的有价证券，它承载着一段特殊的历史，见证着一场举世罕见的鲸吞公有资产的私有化浪潮，同时也让俄罗斯坠入了那个充满苦难的“疯狂的90年代”。<br><br>

那么，这场闹剧的帷幕是从何时拉开的呢?<br><br>

1985年的春天，对于当时的苏联人来说是一个萧瑟料峭的春天。<br><br>

刚刚当上总书记的戈尔巴乔夫踌躇满志。1985年苏共中央四月全会确立加速发展战略后，急于塑造自己改革者形象的戈尔巴乔夫接连到各地的工厂和农村视察。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、俄罗斯科学院经济学部成员奥・季・博戈莫洛夫：“当时社会上对戈尔巴乔夫实行的这种改革有较强烈的抵触情绪，他就慢慢造舆论，让社会接受他的改革。”<br><br>

进入20世纪80年代，苏联仍是世界上两个超级大国之一，社会经济发展能够满足人民的基本需要。但在当时，背离、背叛人民群众的官僚特权集团的存在和发展，严重挫伤了广大人民从事社会主义建设的积极性、主动性和创造性。<br><br>

俄罗斯联邦共产党中央委员会主席根・安・久加诺夫：……官僚特权集团控制着国家，国家对所有权进行垄断，包括集体农庄、合作社，结果带来生产的倒退和停滞不前。当时国家科技人才的发明占世界发明的三分之一，但这些发明得不到有效推广。”<br><br>

俄联邦原政府总理米・米・卡西亚诺夫：“我们能让宇宙飞船升空，能把人带土太空，可不能制造一个彳良盱的收音机。人民渴望改善自己的生活。当时戈尔巴乔夫领导集团也意识到这一点。不进行改革就不能满足人民的需求。”<br><br>

1986年初，苏共召开了二十七大。会议进一步明确了加速发展战略的方针、目标、规划和途径等。此后苏共中央又陆续推出一些经济改革措施。如给予企业一定自主权、减少指令性计划、整顿工作纪律与社会秩序等，并取得了一定成效。<br><br>

但戈尔巴乔夫并不熟悉经济工作，他热衷于空谈，并常常忽东忽西、舍本求末，甚至头痛医脚、脚痛医头。<br><br>

1985年5月，苏联当局决定严格制止酗酒现象。<br><br>

酗酒现象是苏联社会较长期存在的痼疾。但自赫鲁晓夫领导集团始，逐渐脱离、背离广大人民群众根本利益，进一步导致人们精神生活极度苦闷，不少群众感到无能为力，只好凭借酒精消愁。<br><br>

反酗酒很快发展成严厉禁酒，许多地方一天之内就关掉2/3卖酒的商店，酒和酒精类饮料在市面上很快都消失了。<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫同期声：“人们从此把我这个苏共中央总书记称为‘矿泉水书记’”。<br><br>

反酗酒导致国家税收大量减少，却使投机者大发横财。这些投机者在后来的私有化时期就是用这第一桶金来非法攫取国有资产的。<br><br>

反酗酒运动很快以失败而告终。这仅仅是戈尔巴乔夫初期经济改革毫无章法的一个小插曲。<br><br>

对这种朝令夕改的改革，时任部长会议主席的雷日科夫对此也深感无所适从。他在回忆录中这样说道：“在一个月前讲妥要优先发展机械制造业，现在又突然冒出了一连串儿需要优先发展的部门”;“短短的几个月，国民经济优先发展方向的清单不知填写过了多少次”。(24)<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、俄罗斯科学院经济学部成员奥・季・博戈莫洛夫：“当时我已经提出了改革不能从各行各业同时开始，总得有个起点。从这个意义上说，中国的经验对我们有启示意义。首先应该把市场机制引进到农村和城市关系中，把农村和城市的经验结合起来。”<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫听不进也不愿听不同的意见。唯意志论的决策和急躁冒进的思想，很快在苏共领导层占据了上风。<br><br>

从1987年开始，国家制定的计划与指标不能如期完成。原定1986―1990年用于消费和积累的国民收入年均增长3.5%―4.0%，而1986―1988年仅增长2.8%，还低于改革前的速度。<br><br>

更为严重的是，一方面戈尔巴乔夫把经济改革的窘境归因于苏联的政治制度;另一方面经济改革的窘境又为私有化思潮的滋生和蔓延提供着土壤。<br><br>

1988年6月苏共第十九次全国代表会议提出了从根本上进行经济改革的任务，戈尔巴乔夫尝试着为私有化打开大门。<br><br>

此后苏联社会围绕计划与市场、社会主义与市场经济等问题展开了激烈的讨论。<br><br>

先是在社会主义公有制基础上进行改革的观：念受到猛烈的抨击;不久，主张私有化和自由市场经济的思潮大行其道，一夜间竟成为舆论的主流。<br><br>

利用改革掘得第一桶金的暴富者们推波助澜，日夜期盼着手中的非法财富合法化，而掌管大量国有资产的特权官僚集团和蜕化变质的企业管理者则更是蠢蠢欲动，欲乘私有化之机“近水楼台先得月”。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、俄罗斯国立社会大学校长瓦・伊・茹科夫：“当时党的高层精英群体最渴望的就是把国家的财富化为已有。在权力和财富之间总是存在矛盾，有一个不能逾越的界线。比如有人当上了州委书记，他就有各种各样的特权，他就能控制那个州里几乎所有的财富。而一旦退了休，他就会失去这些权力和所掌控的财富。所以他们就极力渴望把这些财富变成自己名下的合法财产。”<br><br>

面对汹涌而来的私有化思潮，作为最高领导人的戈尔巴乔夫先是反对，接着观望，然后是调和、妥协，直至转为完全支持。<br><br>

1989年2月，戈尔巴乔夫说：“我们坚持社会主义所有制，主张在社会主义所有制基础上发挥经济和社会制度的潜力。”他还说：“关心社会主义，相信社会主义，忠于这一制度，不接受私有制，不接受人压迫人的制度，因为所有这些宝贵的东西都与整整几代苏联人血肉相连。”(25)<br><br>

然而到了1990年8月，还是同一个戈尔巴乔夫，以公有制束缚了人的劳动积极性为由，攻击公有制为主体是“经济垄断”，认为改革“主要而又刻不容缓的任务”是取消公有制的“垄断”地位，推行公有企业非国有化、私有化。他还以计划经济没有效率为借口，主张完全放弃国家的宏观调控。<br><br>

为与其政治改革即确立资本主义政治制度相适应，戈尔巴乔夫领导集团即大力推行彻底摧毁社会主义公有制、快速实现资本主义私有化的各项方针政策。<br><br>

1989年下半年，苏联经济继续恶化，高通胀，高物价，失业严重，经济面临崩溃的危险。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、俄罗斯科学院经济学部成员奥・季・博戈莫洛夫：“在1989年下半年到1990年上半年，(苏联政府)一直在研究怎么制定经济改革的方案。在这个过程中，起初出现了另一种方案――沙塔林方案，后经补充、修改形成‘500天计划’。两个方案各有特点。政府方案以雷日科夫为首，以阿巴尔金提供的材料为基础，主张改革在各行各业同时铺开，逐步用市场机制代替计划管理机制。”<br><br>

原苏共中央政治局委员、苏联部长会议主席尼・伊・雷日科夫：“我们建议渐进地推行市场经济。我们研究过中国的改革，希望我们也能逐步地推进。我计算后认为，这至少需要8年时间。”<br><br>

“500天计划”是沙塔林等人经戈尔巴乔夫授权，根据亚夫林斯基、叶利钦等人提出的方案修改、补充而成，目的是与政府方案抗衡。该计划主张在大规模私有化的基础上，从1990年11月1日至1992年3月14日的500天内，分四个阶段将苏联从计划经济迅速过渡到市场经济。经济学家借用医学上的术语，称这一激进方案为“休克疗法”。<br><br>

原苏共中央政治局委员、苏联部长会议主席尼・伊・雷日科夫：“有些人可能是从政治角度提出在500天之内，也就是用一年半的时间完成改革。我认为这是极为冒险的。给我们国家带来的可能是灾难。所以，我个人坚决反对。这是个原则性的问题。”<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、俄罗斯科学院经济学部成员奥・季・博戈莫洛夫：“我个人认为‘500天计划’是一个冒险的计划。在500天里，一年半多一点的时间内，要对经济进行大幅度的改革，是不现实的事情。”<br><br>

面对两种对立的计划，戈尔巴乔夫先是骑墙，后是妥协折中。1990年10月19日，苏最高苏维埃通过由他主持起草的《稳定国民经济和向市场经济过渡的基本方针》，结束了长达半年的经济改革纲领之争。<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫的纲领表面上看介于前两个方案之间，但实质上是全盘接受了亚夫林斯基一沙塔林计划中全面私有化的内容。其主旨是推行非国有化和私有化，以及私有化基础上的自由市场经济。他提出“必须向经济非垄断化、非国有化和私有化大踏步前进”。<br><br>

就是这样一个方案，也遭到叶利钦的强烈反对，并预言“它将以失败而告终”。<br><br>

经济改革方案之争很快转化为尖锐的政治斗争。经济私有化也进入快车道。<br><br>

1990年12月25日，深感无奈的雷日科夫托病辞去苏联部长会议主席职务，原苏联财政部长帕夫洛夫继任。<br><br>

1991年4月，为应对日益严重的经济危机，苏联政府提出反危机纲领，决定进一步加快非国有化和财产私有化。<br><br>

莫斯科大学经济系教授亚・弗・布兹加林：“完全的市场经济就像一只老虎，这只老虎管得不好就会从笼子里跑出来把人吃掉，这就是苏联解体的原因之一。”<br><br>

1991年7月1日，苏最高苏维埃通过了《关于企业非国有化和私有化原则法》。根据这项法律，到1992年底，苏联有近一半的工业企业将脱离国家的控制，到1995年这一比例将达到60%―70%。<br><br>

自1988年夏天，苏联经济形势开始严重恶化。1989年，经济增长逐月下降，1990年开始出现二战后第一次负增长。据统计，1990―1991年苏联经济年均下降近9.5%，而在1991年就达到-15%。(26)<br><br>

经济状况空前恶化，使绝大多数群众的生活变得十分艰难。1991年，日用消费品零售价格比1990年增长了1.4倍，集贸市场价格增长两倍，而黑市和议价贸易的价格则超过零售价格9倍。<br><br>

普希金语言学院副教授德・尼.法捷耶夫：“1990年、1991年开始发行各式各样票证，有蓝色的、粉色的。当时我还小，记得排了大半天的长队。结果轮到我的时候，前边的妇女把最后半公斤香肠买走了，到我这儿什么也没有。我不停地哭，哭完以后，我发誓再也不去商店了。”<br><br>

商场前买东西的老太太：“清早起来排队，(我)排了第一个，想买点茶喝。结果走到(柜台)前，什么也没有了。我退休金不多，只有90卢布。但我已经工作了55年。”

俄罗斯科学院院士、社会政治研究所所长根・瓦・奥希波夫：“我们将要出版一本苏共被瓦解的大事记，其中有民主纲领派会议的速记稿，例如其代表人波波夫就讲：‘我们不考虑人民，我们就是要故意造成全面紧缺的状态。’这是原话。”

当时报刊一针见血地指出：戈尔巴乔夫时代留给人们的印象，首先是称为超级大国的苏联分崩离析，其次是无节制的通货膨胀，再就是80%的人进入贫困状态，成百万的贫困者流落街头。<br><br>

这里需要提及的是，为了说明戈尔巴乔夫开启的私有化改革的恶果，在俄罗斯采访的过程中，我们也特地向完成私有化改革的叶利钦时期做了必要的延伸。<br><br>

苏联解体以后，新独立的国家无一例外地急速推进本国的私有化。叶利钦则比戈尔巴乔夫更为激进。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院经济学部成员奥・季・博戈莫洛夫：“戈尔巴乔夫时期，只是非国有化和私有化的起始阶段，也可以说是孕育阶段。当时采取的形式是建立一些合作社，采用租赁制。比方说，有一些集体可以租赁企业来经营。(俄罗斯)真正大规模的非国有化和私有化，是在苏联解体之后盖达尔推行的经济改革。那时，大规模私有化变得失控。这是叶利钦和丘拜斯错误政策的结果。”<br><br>

1992年，叶利钦选择36岁的盖达尔主管经济改革工作，推行“休克疗法”，希望少则几个月多则一年，快速实现经济自由化和私有化。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、社会政治研究所所长根・瓦・奥希波夫：“为什么选择盖达尔的经济改革方案・ (因为)盖达尔吹嘘，两年以后国家各个方面都会变好。根本不懂经济、心里也毫无把握的叶利钦问他：你能不能向我保证・他说：我不光(向你)承诺，我(还)向土天发誓，我以我先辈的名义发誓。后来开始的所谓经济改革，实际上是野蛮的资本主义。”<br><br>

1991年12月19日，叶利钦发布总统令，批准《1992年国有及市有企业私有化纲要基本原则》。一场“休克疗法”式的改革，在俄罗斯联邦全面铺开。<br><br>

首先放开的是物价。物价很快像断了线的气球扶摇直上。到了4月份，消费品价格就比放开前上涨65倍。<br><br>

企业生产成本因燃料、原料价格放开而骤增。到6月份，工业品批发价格上涨14倍，企业纷纷压缩生产，市场供求进入恶性循环。<br><br>

紧缩信贷造成企业流动资金严重短缺，三角债日益严重，政府被迫放松银根。1992年增发的货币量是上一年发行量的20倍，通货膨胀率在印钞机的轰鸣中高达2509%，到1996年，物价上涨了6000多倍。<br><br>

“休克疗法”的核心内容就是私有化。盖达尔认为，俄罗斯唯一能走的只有市场化这一条道路，而市场经济与公有制水火不容，因此必须彻底实行私有化。<br><br>

被称为俄罗斯“私有化之父”、担任过俄副总理兼政府私有化委员会主席的丘拜斯则说：“无论把财产分给谁，哪怕是分给强盗，只要把财产从国家手里夺出来就好。”(27)<br><br>

俄罗斯大规模私有化是从无偿发放私有化证券开始的。当时，俄罗斯固定资产总量估算为4.3万亿卢布，政府决定先将其中的35%即1.5万亿卢布，无偿分发给近1.5亿的俄罗斯居民。每个在1992年9月2日以前出生的俄罗斯人，都可以领到本集开头出现的一张面值1万卢布――当时相当子25美元的私有化证券，使人人真正成为国有资产的所有者和受益者。<br><br>

莫斯科银行间外汇交易所史料信息中心主任尤里・彼德罗维奇：“政府发行私有化证券，老百姓把他们获得的证券投到企业里，这样就可以获得企业的股份。通过这种途径把原来的国有企业转化成股份制企业。但后来局势失控了。很多老百姓手里的私有化券被一些人收购，这些人变成企业的大股东。”<br><br>

随着物价飞涨，卢布大幅度贬值，不少民众纷纷低价出售甚至无偿转让私有化券，而一些企业的管理者和握有资金的投机者乘机低价收购。<br><br>

俄联邦政府原劳动和社会发展部部长谢・维・卡拉什尼科夫：“当时，有的人站在企业的门口，给工人一瓶酒，就可以换张券。当时发的(私有化)券，对很多人来说，实际上毫无用处。”<br><br>

莫斯科外汇交易所史料信息中心主任尤里・彼德罗维奇：“收购之后，有些人就把私有化券集中投到一家企业，(这样)他就成了这家企业的控股人，原来的国有企业就成为一家私人企业，也就出现了私营企业主和寡头。”<br><br>

俄联邦政府原劳动和社会发展部部长谢・维・卡拉什尼科夫：可以说大部分的企业都被私有化了。除了国家订货的国防企业，别的都卖了。也不是卖了，实际是拱手让给私人了。国家没得到什么东西。”<br><br>

那些收买了国有企业的人，关心的不是企业的长远发展，而是尽快转手盈利。职工既领不到股息，又无权参与决策，生产经营无人过问，企业效益每况愈下。<br><br>

从1994年7月开始，俄罗斯对国有大中型企业实行有偿私有化，到1996年底基本结束。<br><br>

不少国有企业的领导者乘企业改制分配股权之机，利用行政或管理权力掌握股票控制权。昔日的“红色”经理或厂长，摇身一变成了资本家。企业管理者、各级官员以及暴发户们串通一气，大搞钱权交易，按照远低于实际价值的价格，收购政府拍卖的企业。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、经济学部成员奥・季・博戈莫洛夫：“在私有化之前没有对企业做过资产评估，企业卖得基本土一文不值，实际土是象征性地卖出去了。由于卢布贬值很厉害，企业的账目赢亏与实际情况不符，很难对企业资产准确评估。究竟企业值多少钱，账户还有多少钱，都没有算清就卖了。”<br><br>

莫斯科大学经济系教授亚・弗・布兹加林：“国营企业厂长低价把产品卖给私营企业，他的老婆或者女儿在那工作，结果私营企业变富了，国营企业却变穷了、破产了。厂长经理辞职不干了，就变成私营企业的老板，自己就发了大财了。”<br><br>

乌拉尔机械制造厂是一家拥有3.4万名职工的大型国有机器制造企业，当时仅卖了372万美元。低价贱卖的企业远不止这一家。500家大型国有企业实际价值超过l万亿美元，却只卖了72亿美元。12.5万家国有企业平均售价只有1300美元。<br><br>

在私有化过程中，有数千亿美元的资金外逃，俄罗斯一些具有战略意义的经济门类被俄国寡头控制，而大量掌握核心军工机密和国防工业的专家流失西方。<br><br>

这是一次“世纪大拍卖”。这是人类历史上最迅速、最疯狂的私有化，这是少数当权者利用手中的权力疯狂瓜分和掠夺全体人民财产的强盗行为。他们乘私有化改革之机，损公肥私，化公为私，把苏联几代人艰苦奋斗积累的成果，瞬间化为自己口袋里的财富。其结果是，造就了占总人口5%―7%的俄罗斯新贵，而使1亿多人口陷入赤贫，与之相随的还有社会的分裂和动荡。<br><br>

许多俄罗斯人称20世纪90年代为充满苦难的“疯狂年代”。<br><br>

在那个年代里，全面私有化使“犯罪经济”、“强盗经济”和“寡头经济”盛行，生产急遽下降，卢布贬值，物价飞涨，贫富两极迅速分化。<br><br>

莫斯科市民亚历山大・贡恰罗夫：“在90年代，一直到1998年，情况都很差，我都丢掉工作了。在八个月里我一直在找工作，处于收入为零的状态。”<br><br>

就连著名的自由市场经济代表人物俄联邦原政府总理米・米・卡西亚诺夫也不得不承认：“90年代确实是一个很艰难的时期，俄罗斯民众承受了这场苦难。这场苦难把居民的收入和存款突然化为零……使居民的收入、物质生活水平下降了百分之三十。”<br><br>

俄罗斯联邦前劳动和社会发展部部长亚・彼・波奇诺克：“90年代俄罗斯局势发展到什么境地呢?当时的烟都不够抽。如果生产出什么烟，商店寸巴整包烟打开，论支卖。酒类产品也很紧张。即便售货亭安着铁栅栏，人们为了买酒就把铁栅栏扒开。”<br><br>

私有化改革使得社会财富分配严重两极分化，社会主义理想信念严重缺失，伦理道德观念极度混乱，社会精神全面倒退。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、社会政治研究所所长根・瓦・奥希波夫：“叶利钦和他手下的人推行改革所造成的破坏和损失，从物质层面或者从精神层面来讲，可以说超过了第二次世界大战。”<br><br>

“休克疗法”的始作俑者之一盖达尔后来坦言，俄罗斯私有化是“权贵阶层将国家财产私有化”，是将“权力转化为资本”。而丘拜斯则道出了快速私有化的缘由：私有化与其说是解决经济问题，倒不如说是解决政治问题，是“5%的经济加95%的政治”。对于俄罗斯来说，要创造一个新生的资产阶级，更重要的是要摧毁共产主义政权遗留的经济基础。(28)<br><br>

《世纪大拍卖》的作者、英国《金融时报》副主编克里斯蒂娅・弗里兰称，俄罗斯私有化改革通向的是“青面獠牙的霍布斯资本主义”、“强盗资本主义”和“裙带的、腐败的资本主义”。<br><br>

在莫斯科街头采访的日子里，我们在一个地铁通道的墙上，看到这样一条显赫的标语“资本主义就是死亡!”<br><br>

 

第三集“公开性”与指导思想“多元化”<br><br>

这是莫斯科市中心一个文化公园的偏僻一角，这里堆放着列宁、斯大林和斯维尔德洛夫、捷尔任斯基等领导人的塑像。这些塑像不仅残破不全、伤痕累累，有的甚至被油漆涂抹得面目全非。<br><br>

上了年纪的莫斯科人都知道，这些雕塑曾伫立在莫斯科各个环境优美、行人如织的地方。它们曾是众人景仰的历史丰碑，曾是苏联共产党的无比骄傲。<br><br>

然而在20世纪80年代后期，在苏联全国上下刮起的那股否定苏联历史的狂潮中，这些塑像连同无产阶级革命领袖的功绩与人格，遭到疯狂的攻击和嘲弄。<br><br>

这是戈尔巴乔夫倡导所谓“公开性”和指导思想“多元化”引发的一个严重恶果。<br><br>

所谓“公开性”是戈尔巴乔夫上台后不久确立并推动的一项重要改革方针。<br><br>

1986年2月，在戈尔巴乔夫、雅科夫列夫积极谋划下，苏共二十七大正式提出所谓“公开性”的问题。<br><br>

列宁当年使用过“公开性”一词，其原意是把党和政府的工作对人民群众公开，听取群众意见，改进党和政府工作，以便得到群众的理解和支持。列宁同时强调“公开性”不是无限的、无原则的。
<br><br>
而到了戈尔巴乔夫那里，“公开性”在“让人民知道一切”、不留“被遗忘的人物和空白点”等口号掩护下，变成专门揭露党和国家历史上的所谓“阴暗面”和“消极现象”甚至是歪曲与伪造历史的工具，变成从根本上动摇马克思列宁主义指导地位、推行人道的民主社会王义改革的突破口。<br><br>

原苏共中央意识形态部部长亚・谢・卡普托：“‘公开性’在党内是件很震撼的事情。本来‘公开性’是为了让人民获得更多的信息，然而在大众传媒完全放开以后，所有的报道没有一点社会责任感，‘公开性’使大众媒体成了反共反社会主义的工具。它所造成的影响自苏联解体后一直持续至今。”<br><br>

为加强对所谓“公开性”工作的组织领导，戈尔巴乔夫专门选调雅科夫列夫任苏共中央宣传部长，又先后擢升他为中央书记和政治局委员，主管意识形态工作。<br><br>

雅科夫列夫随即对苏联主要报刊和新闻媒体的领导班子进行大幅度的调整，排斥坚持原则、维护党和国家利益的共产党人，并把支持戈尔巴乔夫改革的亲信安排在各个重要领导岗位上，从而牢牢控制了思想舆论界的领导权。<br><br>

首当其冲的是苏共中央最重要理论刊物《共产党人》。主编马克思主义者科索拉波夫被解除职务，取代他的是戈尔巴乔夫亲自挑选的、他夫人赖莎的好友、带有自由化倾向的弗罗洛夫。<br><br>

1986年6月，《星火》杂志主编由雅科夫列夫挑选的政治上的两面派――科罗季奇接任。此后，该刊物就成为反共反社会王义思想的先锋。<br><br>

俄罗斯作家联盟莫斯科组织执行主席弗・伊・古谢夫：“科罗季奇是一位思想很偏激的人。他接任《星火》画报主编后，发表了很多阴阳怪气的政论文章。后来，大凡具有爱国主义精神的人都认为，《星火》画报是完全为西方资产阶级服务的一本杂志。”<br><br>

在雅科夫列夫的干预和影响下，《真理报》、《莫斯科新闻》、《消息报》、《文学报》、《共青团真理报》等中央报刊主编遭撤换，10种主要大型文学杂志中有7种杂志的主编被更换。一大批主张西化的编辑记者被起用。这些报刊很快成为自由派的宣传工具，成为反马克思主义、反社会主义的阵地。<br><br>

一批过去被禁止的反社会主义的文学作品和电影纷纷被解除了封印。<br><br>

1986年底，专门用歪曲手法描写斯大林时期所谓“阴暗面”的别克的小说《新任命》解禁出版。
<br><br>
1987年，歪曲斯大林时期的党内斗争，暗示基洛夫遇刺是斯大林一手策划的雷巴科夫的小说《阿尔巴特街的儿女们》公开面世。<br><br>

俄罗斯作家联盟莫斯科市组织理事会主席、欧亚作家协会主席弗・格・博亚里诺夫：“雷巴科夫也是一位共产党员。推行‘公开性’后，他捕捉到时代已开始发生了变化，即决定自己也要跟着变化一下。于是，他就把斯大林搬上解剖台。在那个时期只要能写几笔的人都在抹黑斯大林。雷巴科夫就推出了《阿尔巴特街的儿女们》。作品引起了轰动，内容既有纪实材料，更有艺术虚构，还引进了爱情故事，但本质上是给斯大林脸上抹黑。在那个时候，谁先冲上去，谁首先反对斯大林，谁就是英雄。”<br><br>

1986年12月，格鲁吉亚影片《忏悔》公开放映。这部片子是在时任格鲁吉亚第一书记谢瓦尔德纳泽的支持下拍摄的。影片以寓言的方式攻击斯大林时期所谓的“独裁制度”。雅科夫列夫说：《忏悔》的公映是苏共“意识形态崩溃的开始”。<br><br>

俄罗斯作家联盟莫斯科市组织理事会主席、欧亚作家协会主席弗・格・博亚里诺夫：“‘公开性’，使很多人头脑发热，那些持不同政见者都跳了出来。他们利用这个时机，接二连三地出版了很多作品。这些作品对苏联亡党亡国起了推波助澜的作用。”<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫后来承认，这些作品的公开出版或放映是经他本人点头的。(29)他还充满感慨地说：“真可惜，在大学时代竟然没能读到这―切!”(30)<br><br>

大批文学作品的解禁在当时被称为继赫鲁晓夫的“解冻”以后的“第二次解冻”。<br><br>

电视的宣传威力更为巨大。苏联国家电视台开设的一些政论性专栏，不仅言辞激烈，思想偏激，甚至煽风点火，造谣惑众。一些自由派人士走上电视屏幕，揭露苏联历史的所谓“空白点”，为反共反社会主义大造舆论。<br><br>

为进一步推动指导思想“多元化”，1990年6月12日，戈尔巴乔夫以总统名义批准《新闻出版法》，宣布所谓的“新闻自由”。7月15日，他又发布关于电视和广播民主化的总统令，规定国家电视和广播事业“独立于政治和社会组织”，不允许任何政党进行垄断。这是戈尔巴乔夫“坚决舍弃苏共在政治上和意识形态领域的领导地位”而迈出的关键一步。<br><br>

原苏共中央意识形态部部长亚・谢・卡普托：“《新闻出版法》这个法律不是关于出版的法律，而是为出版者制定的一套法律。法律只考虑出版界的经济利益，而不考虑国家和社会的利益。在此之前，国家对出版物都是有约束的，比如发表文章或播放节目都有专门的机构如党的委员会审查。而现在这些都被取消了，对新闻媒体没有任何的约束，只要有了钱，想出版什么都可以。”<br><br>

1990年上半年，苏境内各种非正式出版物多达上千种。《新闻出版法》颁布后，反对派和私人办报合法化。《论据与事实》、《莫斯科新闻》等官方报刊也纷纷宣布“自主办报”，完全摆脱苏共和主管部门的束缚。到苏联解体前，苏共掌握的报刊仅占1.5%。<br><br>

私人办报合法化和官办媒体私营化以后，苏联主要媒体很快被苏境内外私有资本和权贵势力掌控。国内外资本竭力丑化颠覆社会主义制度，宣扬美化资本主义的永恒统治。这就是他们鼓吹的“新闻自由”的本质。<br><br>

解禁文学作品和实行“新闻自由”只是“公开性”的开始。随着“公开无限制，，方针的推行，一股气势汹汹的否定苏共和苏联的历史虚无主义思潮，迅速蔓延至史学界、理论界、思想界。<br><br>

到1987年形成一场反思历史、重评历史的运动。1988年以后不断升级，一浪高过一浪。形形色色的境内外反共反社会主义分子，追随赫鲁晓夫“秘密报告”的论调，从批判斯大林和斯大林主义入手，进而攻击、诽谤列宁和十月革命，再进而否定整个苏联和苏联共产党。<br><br>

2010年4月，我们在俄罗斯采访，俄中友协主席、俄罗斯科学院院士季塔连科多次给我们谈道：“苏联的解体也与某些知识分子脱离群众，以一己私利代替国家利益和人民利益分不开。在列宁斯大林时代，广大知识分子能与群众保持着密切的联系，与人民群众利益根本一致。斯大林去世后，自由化现象加剧，部分知识分子的权力逐渐扩张。但当时苏联的国内环境仍在压缩着知识分子自由化的空间，于是企图谋取自己特殊利益的那部分知识分子便把目光瞄向国外，通过内外勾结推动苏联解体，进而攫取俄罗斯更多的资源，从而成为戈尔巴乔夫领导集团巅覆社会主义苏联的一个极为特殊的阶层。”<br><br>

为了否定马克思列宁主义指导地位，戈尔巴乔夫还打起“多元化”的幌子。他无视全体苏联人民根本利益的一致性，以社会存在不同利益群体为由，伙同思想、理论、舆论、文艺等意识形态精英，竭力提倡“意见多元论”、“言论多样化”，宣扬个人主义和利己主义，并以让各种思想“自由竞赛”为借口，提出实行意识形态“多元化”，进而攻击坚持马列主义为指导是“精神垄断”，取消马克思列宁主义在意识形态领域的指导地位，为确立人道的民主社会主义的指导地位鸣锣开道。<br><br>

雅科夫列夫公然宣扬共产主义是乌托邦，污蔑十月革命是“少数暴徒发动的政变”，是“魔鬼之歌的序曲”。他还重拾起早就被粉碎的谣言，攻击十月革命是德国总参谋部一项秘密计划的实现，列宁是接受德皇资助从内部瓦解沙皇统治的德国秘密代理人。<br><br>

“民主联盟”主要成员尤・阿法纳西耶夫宣称：整个苏联的历史是靠使用武力和暴力写成的。(31)<br><br>

1987年7月，《消息报》载文谴责苏联过去的中小学历史教材，认为以前的历史教科书中“每一个字都充满了谎言”。<br><br>

1988年6月，苏联教育主管部门做出决定，取消当年中小学历史课的考试，要求全国所有学校的苏联历史课本在1989年全部销毁。<br><br>

1989年12月，苏联国家国民教育委员会颁布命令，全面取消大学和其他高等院校的马列主义课程。<br><br>

攻击领袖、否定历史的手法多种多样。被30年代“大清洗”迫害致死的人数，成几何级数地翻番。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、俄罗斯国立社会大学校长瓦・伊・茹科夫：“在斯大林统治的时候，有过大规模的镇压，这是事实。被镇压的人都是有名有姓的，整个苏联时期共87万多人。这个数据是真实的。后来有很多人说‘大清洗’差不多杀了1000万或者1500万，这是严重失实的。”<br><br>

在后来的交谈中，茹科夫还告诉我们：“至于有人蓄意攻击肃反杀了2000万到3000万人则更是别有用心。肃反中确有扩大化甚至严重扩大化的现象，但是其中对‘第五纵队’的无情打击，则对于确保卫国战争的胜利起着至关重要的作用。”茹科夫又说：“对肃反扩大化问题，斯大林当然应该负有责任，但是赫鲁晓夫同样责任难逃。当时在他负责的地区，就杀了6万多人，有不少就是枉杀。在他就任总书记后，又利用职权，把相关档案全部销毁。”<br><br>

原《真理报》主编、前杜马主席根・尼・谢列兹尼奥夫：“那段时间，把一切都忘记了，都失去了理智。共产党所做的事情都被忘记了，对共产党领导苏联人民在二战时期建立的功勋、取得的伟大胜利也都被忘记了，共产党在二战之后迅速恢复和发展国民经济的成就也被忘记了。后来在90年代最惨的就是那些老战士。当着他们的面侮辱历史、侮辱过去。他们觉得自己的命运遭到了嘲弄。”<br><br>

1988年6月，对莫斯科人的一次调查表明，只有不到8%的人正面评价斯大林的历史作用。(32)<br><br>

俄罗斯著名作家《明天》报副主编弗・格・邦达连科：“我也知道，斯大林是一个严酷的人，但实际上他采取的各种措施和决定，是受制于当时的历史条件的，是当时不得不采取的。在结束新经济政策以后，斯大林就面临这样一个问题：在苏联的领导层里面，在中层领导干部里面，实际上已经出现严重的腐败现象。如果斯大林不采取严厉的措施，腐败现象就可能蔓延到全国，苏联在20年代就有解体的危险。”<br><br>

原苏共中央政治局委员叶・库利加乔夫：“戈尔巴乔夫无数次攻击斯大林搞迫害。评价历史人物应该有原则。这一原则是由列宁确定的。从这一原则出发，斯大林是一个伟大的人物。戈尔巴乔夫和雅科夫列夫认为斯大林时期是迫害时期，他们没有把斯大林与当时苏联取得的成就联系在一起。”<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、俄罗斯国立社会大学校长瓦・伊・茹科夫：“不同的史学家对斯大林、对我们的国家采取了不同的态度。我们对有些史学家所作出的结论是决不能同意的，因为这与斯大林个人做出的伟大成就是完全不相符的。我们绝不能忘记斯大林接手的是一个遭受严重破坏、处于战争废墟的国家。而到50年代初，苏联已经变成――个庞大的发达国家，居欧洲第一位、世界第二位。”<br><br>

所谓“公开性”、舆论“多元化”，不仅把苏共和苏联的光辉历史给颠覆了，把资本主义甚至帝国主义给美化了，而且只允许反共反社会主义的观点、思想公开发表，而决不许坚持马克思主义立场的人进行反驳。安德烈耶娃事件就是对所谓“公开性”、舆论“多元化”的一个绝妙的注解与讽刺。<br><br>

1988年3月13日，《苏维埃俄罗斯报》发表了列宁格勒工学院女教师尼娜・安德烈耶娃的一封读者来信，批评苏联大地掀起否定斯大林和苏联历史的逆流。此信很快被各共和国、地区、城市和行业报纸转载937次。安德烈耶娃本人所在的工学院也收到来自全国各地、社会各个阶层人士成千上万的信件，其中超过80%的来信充分肯定作者的看法。<br><br>

然而，安德烈耶娃的信在党内高层却引发了轩然大波。<br><br>

原苏共中央政治局委员叶・库利加乔夫：“为了这件事，政治局连续召开了两天的会议，由戈尔巴乔夫主持。他们要找出谁是此事的主谋。大家都在质问我，只是没有说出我的名字而已。我总体上正面评价这篇文章。你看多有意思：一封信，一封捍卫苏联、捍卫苏联人民的信，在政治局讨论了两天;而成千上万的反苏联反人民的信，政治局一次也没有讨论过。两周后，戈尔巴乔夫对我说：‘我们搞清楚了，背后不是你，但你支持她的观点。’在清查此事的过程中，雅科夫列夫等人更是卖劲。但也有不少人赞同安德烈耶娃的观点。”<br><br>

会后，戈尔巴乔夫和雅科夫列夫组织文章公开批判安德烈耶娃的来信，认为这是“反改革分子的宣言”。接着，苏联各大报刊纷纷转载并对来信大加讨伐。<br><br>

对一名普通党员反映问题的来信，戈尔巴乔夫、雅科夫列夫等人如此兴师动众、批判问责，一个重要的目的就是要借题发挥，打压马克思主义派，为即将召开的彻底转向资本主义的苏共第十九次代表会议做思想舆论和组织上的准备。<br><br>

“公开性，，和指导思想“多元化”，本质上就是取消马列主义的指导地位，使党失去正确而统一的指导思想的理论基础和行动指南，从而使苏共的性质发生根本变化，使资产阶级思想成为其指导思想的一元。<br><br>

“公开性”和指导思想“多元化”还带来历史虚无主义的泛滥。历史虚无主义的泛滥带来了极其严重的后果。<br><br>

反共分子公开焚烧列宁像，要求将列宁的遗体从红场迁出。列宁、斯大林等苏共领导人的塑像严重被毁。党在不明真相的群众中的地位急速滑落。<br><br>

广大党员共产主义理想信念动摇，对党的前途失去信心。大批党员退党，苏共由1900万党员骤减为1500万;退回到1973年的人数。<br><br>

不仅如此，反共反苏势力还发动报刊把批判矛头指向苏共领导的军队。他们污蔑卫国战争的胜利不过是“大法西斯打败了小法西斯”，而经济衰退则是军队这只怪兽吸干了国家血汗的结果。<br><br>

曾被视作为党和人民事业的卫士被丑化成极权制度的帮凶。诋毁军人及其家属、否定军队曾经有过的革命历史成为时髦。1989年第比利斯四月事件后，本来是维护国家统一的军队成了出师无名的不义之师，而煽动民族分裂的暴乱分子反而成了无辜的受害者。<br><br>

反苏反共势力的无端攻击、歪曲和诋毁使苏军广大官兵理想信念发生动摇，军队“非政治化”、“非党化”、“国家化”思潮泛滥。不同民族、不同地区的官兵关系紧张。<br><br>

军队构成也日益复杂，党在军队中的影响也日趋下降。1988年入伍新兵中自称是“非正式组织”成员的占到13%。1988年军人入党人数下降21%，一年后则达到23.3%。退党和交党证现象屡见不鲜。逃兵事件时有发生，仅1990年就有3万余人。<br><br>

随着苏共丧失领导军队的地位和权力，这支由列宁亲手缔造的历经无数战火考验的强大武装，已由维护苏维埃政权的坚强后盾，变成摇摇欲坠的“泥足巨人”。<br><br>

而主张西化的“民主派”与民族分裂势力正是利用苏共自我丑化、自我否定、主动让权和解除武装之机，夺取了苏共的政权，解体了苏联。<br><br>

20年过去了。当今俄罗斯人反思那段令人心悸的岁月，仍痛惜为此付出的高昂代价。<br><br>

俄罗斯社会大学鲁扎分校校长拉丽莎・科托娃：“我们所有人包括老战士，当我们年轻的时候，都经历过那个困难阶段。可我们都挺了过来。后来，这段光荣历史遭到否定，我们感到十分难过。现在，这些历史在慢慢恢复，我们才感到有一些安慰。”<br><br>

鲁扎某学校历史课教师马林娜・科夫希科娃：“如果一个民族失去了历史的记忆，那这个民族注定是不幸的。在年轻人里，培养这种记忆历史的情感，是我们面临的一项任务。”<br><br>

二战老兵、鲁扎区老战士委员会书记鲍里斯・科多夫：“我认为苏联值得怀念，因为苏联战胜了德国法西斯，赢得了第二次世界大战的胜利，还战胜了日本法西斯。苏联留下了很多宝贵的精神品德，我们要把它们一代代地传下去。”<br><br>

这是一座以“母亲”命名的卫国战争纪念广场。在俄罗斯人民的心中，母亲就是祖国，祖国就是母亲。<br><br>

在这里，我们意外地遇上一对年轻人在举行婚礼。<br><br>

新郎：“在这喜庆的日子，我们来到祖国母亲纪念碑身边，为她献上一束花，为那些在1941年到1945年卫国战争中牺牲的战士们献土一束花。”<br><br>

为祖国母亲献花，为那些为保卫祖国母亲而牺牲的英雄们献花，是这座城市每一对年轻人举行婚礼最庄严、最神圣的仪式。<br><br>

俄罗斯著名作家《明天》报副主编弗・格・邦达连科：“现在差不多有70%的俄罗斯老百姓很尊敬斯大林。无论是年迈的老人，还是二十几岁的青年人都很尊敬他。”<br><br>

2010年7月，俄罗斯第五频道开播了一个名为“时代法庭”电视辩论节目，其主题主要涉及苏联历史上有争议的问题。当辩论“布尔什维克是挽救了俄国还是葬送了俄国”这一问题时，72%的电视观众和88%的互联网网民认为是布尔什维克挽救了俄国。当辩论“戈尔巴乔夫的改革是一场灾难还是走出绝境的出路”时，93%的电视观众和86%的互联网网民认为，戈尔巴乔夫的改革是一场灾难。<br><br>

因上述两个结论完全出乎被资本操纵的主办方的预料，这场辩论在中途便被操纵者强行终止。<br><br>

斯大林曾在反法西斯卫国战争时期说过：“我知道，在我死后会有人向我的坟墓抛垃圾的。但历史之风会残酷无情地将它吹掉!”(33)<br><br>

事实正是这样。今天的俄罗斯，历史的记忆被重新唤起。那些曾被推倒的伟人和英雄的塑像，近些年来逐渐被人们重新竖立起来。许多曾被颠倒的东西，也在人民的心目中重新矗立起来。<br><br>

不，在人民的心中，真正的历史从来就没有被颠倒过。<br><br>

 

第四集 外交“新思维”与和平演变<br><br>

俄罗斯国立社会大学在当今俄罗斯是一所很有影响的高等院校。2010年9月21日，这里举办了一场以“信息战”为主题的研讨会。<br><br>

苏联时期的外交家，曾任苏联驻埃及和土耳其大使，现为“全俄阿塞拜疆人大会”执行主席的埃利达尔・古拉莫维奇・库利耶夫，以自己的亲身经历，讲述了西方对苏联及俄罗斯进行的一场场没有硝烟的战争。<br><br>

原苏联驻埃及和土耳其大使埃・古・库利耶夫：“从20世纪70年代起，以美国为首的西方国家，主要是北约国家，它们花费了很多的资金和人力，抑制苏联的发展，最终目的是让苏联不要存在。因为在他们眼里，苏联对美国是最大的威胁。”<br><br>

美国中央情报局前雇员彼得・施瓦茨在一本著作中写道：“谈论苏联崩溃而不知道美国秘密战略的作用，就像调查一件神秘突然死亡案子而不考虑谋杀、死亡事件是否存在着特殊反常和预谋一样”。(34)<br><br>

自世界上诞生第一个社会主义国家以来，西方垄断资产阶级就把运用各种手段颠覆社会主义政权、推翻社会主义制度，作为其对外战略的一项根本任务。<br><br>

俄罗斯联邦共产党中央委员会主席根・安・久加诺夫：“在1945年苏联人民和中国人民战胜了德国法西斯和日本军国主义之后，西方世界就得出这样一个结论：想再用战争方法、用军事行动战胜苏联和中国这样的大国已经不可能了。杜勒斯马土制订了一个新战略。”<br><br>

曾被誉为美国中央情报局之父的艾伦・杜勒斯一方面鼓吹“冷战”，对苏联推行“战争边缘”政策，威胁要实行“大规模核报复”;另一方面说：“我们一定要在苏联内部找到我们思想意识的人，找到我们的同盟军”。从苏联内部寻找同盟军，这就是杜勒斯为西方世界制订的对苏新战略。<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、社会政治研究所所长根・瓦・奥希波夫：“针对社会主义国家，西方世界曾开列600多亿美元宣传费用进行和平演变。美国政府署名顾问基辛格讲：‘干什么要花这么多钱进行宣传?不如直接在苏共党内建立第五纵队，培养我们的代理人’。”<br><br>

“第五纵队”称谓源自1936年的西班牙内战时期，是对国家叛徒和民族内奸的总称。<br><br>

当历史的时针指向1984年的时候，西方认为他们从苏联内部找到了最合适的代理人，一支值得信赖和依靠的“第五纵队”。<br><br>

1984年底，时任苏共中央政治局委员的戈尔巴乔夫访问英国。戈尔巴乔夫主动示好的坦诚以及他在议会发表“核时代必然要求人们有新的政治思维”的主旨演讲，给首相撒切尔夫人和她的智囊团留下了深刻印象。<br><br>

雷日科夫认为：这是戈尔巴乔夫同西方合作的开始，也是西方对苏共未来总书记的一次摸底会见。会见后撒切尔夫人抛出了一句名言：“这是个可以与之打交道的人……他值得信赖。”后来，她不无自豪地说：“是我们把戈尔巴乔夫提拔起来当了总书记。(35)<br><br>

两年后的1986年10月，美国总统里根应戈尔巴乔夫的提议：，在冰岛首都雷克雅未克举行了两国领导人的会见。他们进行了长时间一对一的秘密会谈。<br><br>

直到1993年，戈尔巴乔夫在法国揭开了这次他与里根谈判的谜底。他承认此次会见“实际上已把苏联交付美国听凭处置”。他说：“雷克雅未克实际上是一场戏……一场重头大戏…我认为，如果没有里根这样强有力的人物，(苏东剧变)整个过程就不会开始……这次峰会上我们……走得已经那么远，根本就不能再有回头路。(36)<br><br>

1991年11月，卸任一年的英国原首相撒切尔夫人应邀在美国休斯敦举办的美国石油学会的一次会议上发表了约45分钟的演讲，中心内容可以称为“我们是怎样瓦解苏联的”。<br><br>

原苏联最高苏维埃主席阿・伊・卢基扬诺夫：“撒切尔夫人在这次演讲中说，苏联对于西方来说是一个威胁，但是我指的不是军事上的威胁，因为我们在军事上足够强大，尤其是在核武器方面。苏联对于我们的威胁主要是对社会主义制度优越性的展示。”<br><br>

撒切尔夫人直言不讳地说：我们一直采取行动，旨在削弱苏联经济。但遗憾的是，无论我们如何努力，苏联的政治形势长期保持十分稳定，我们由此陷入了困境。不过，很快便得到情报，说苏联领导人契尔年科逝世后，经我们帮助的人可能继任，借助他能够实现我们的想法，这个人就是戈尔巴乔夫。我的智囊们对此人的评价是：不够谨慎，容易被诱导，极其爱好虚荣。他与苏联政界大多数精英关系良好，因此，通过我们的帮助，他能够掌握大权。<br><br>

随着改革的展开，戈尔巴乔夫很快成为西方的宠儿。西方政要赞赏他的调门也越提越高。美国前总统卡特更是肉麻地吹捧戈尔巴乔夫是“世界上最引人注目、最有吸引力、最有创新精神的领导人”。<br><br>

对此，戈尔巴乔夫很是得意。曾长期担任总书记助理的博尔金回忆：“戈尔巴乔夫沉醉于国内外尤其是西方舆论对其‘开明君主’形象的反映。他经常大声朗读国外对他在世界上的伟大改革的评价，这种东西有时他会读上几个小时，而时间就这样一点一点地过去了，而大量的文件他还没有看”。(37)<br><br>

西方不仅给予戈尔巴乔夫精神鼓励，而且还进行物质引诱，让他分泌更多的“异质”新思维。据博尔金回忆：“戈尔巴乔夫在上台后不久就从西方得到许多奖金、奖品、稿费，其个人账户上很快就有了一百多万美元”。(39)<br><br>

俄罗斯著名历史学家、政论家罗伊・麦德维杰夫说：“我的一本厚书，在美国出版，得了几千美元。但戈尔巴乔夫的夫人赖莎薄薄一本小书，在美国出版，却得了300万美元的稿酬。”<br><br>

苏联国家安全委员会原主席弗・亚・克留奇科夫1993年2月13日在《苏维埃俄罗斯报》上披露：“我在20世纪80年代下半期，从几个可靠的来源获悉，雅科夫列夫1960年在美国哥伦比亚大学进修期间被美国特工机关收买并在苏联‘改革’期间接受过美国方面的指示。”(44)<br><br>

俄罗斯科学院院士、社会政治研究所所长根・瓦・奥希波夫：“国家安全委员会主席克留奇科夫手里有一份名单，是出卖国家和党的利益的人。当他把这份名单交给戈尔巴乔夫的时候，戈尔巴乔夫说不要玩你们那些间谍的游戏。”<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫的态度使苏联安全部门当时无法对雅科夫列夫和其他人员进行立案调查。<br><br>

1989年上台的美国总统布什加紧实施针对苏联的和平演变攻势。他采取一项既支持戈尔巴乔夫又扶持政治反对派的上下结合的“双轨政策”，积极培植和壮大苏境内反共反苏的力量。<br><br>

在苏联国内，从20世纪60年代下半期起，就开始出现所谓的持不同政见者。这些人组成复杂，动因各异，但其中不少的确是亲西方的政治上的反对派;西方世界不断以民主、自由、人权等为幌子，积极扶植他们。1970年、1975年西方把诺贝尔文学奖、和平奖分别奖给苏联持不同政见者索尔仁尼琴和萨哈罗夫。<br><br>

1985年以前，由于苏联党和政府防范较严，持不同政见者只是时断时续地从事地下活动，在苏联国内政治影响并不大。<br><br>

原苏联驻埃及和土耳其大使埃・古・库利耶夫：“(持不同政见者)利用苏联国内的困难，投机取巧，扩大自身的宣传，并当成生意来.做。西方国家很快找到这部分人，向他们提供资金，供养他们，并把极个别的现象扩大为整个社会的问题。西方就是利用几十个持不同政见者，向全世界宣传苏联没有言论自由。”<br><br>

戈尔巴乔夫上台后，随着超阶级“新思维”的推行，萨哈罗夫等持不同政见者的头面人物相继获得了合法身份，公开进行反共反社会主义的政治活动。<br><br>

很快，萨哈罗夫伙同叶利钦、波波夫、阿法纳西耶夫等人不负西方厚望，逼迫苏共取消苏联宪法第六条。“非正式组织”也在西方的支持下，向苏共展开了疯狂的夺权活动。<br><br>

支持和利用苏共内部的反叛势力，借助他们打压苏共党内坚持马克思主义的所谓“传统派”，使亲西方的改革变得不可逆转，对美国等西方国家来说意义更为重大。<br><br>

原苏联最高苏维埃主席阿・伊.卢基扬诺夫：“美驻苏代办乔治・凯南1947年就讲：哪怕稍微削弱一下苏共，苏联就会从一个强国变成一个弱得可怜的国家。打击了苏共的团结，就是对苏联最大的打击;破坏了苏共的统一，就是破坏了国家的统一，就会使经济和社会发生混乱。现在所有的人都认识到了这一点。”<br><br>

俄罗斯联邦共产党中央委员会主席根・安・久加诺夫：“(西方)采取一切措施，千方百计地分化、瓦解苏共，让苏共从内部变得难以控制。他们为什么把主要矛头对准苏共?因为苏共是团结领导全体苏联人的磐石，不摧垮这个磐石，他们目的就达不到。”<br><br>

随着苏共党内分歧日益严重，特别是随着叶利钦在苏联政坛的迅速崛起，西方决定在支持戈尔巴乔夫的同时支持叶利钦。<br><br>

1989年9月，已是苏联最高苏维埃主席团成员的叶利钦访问美国。美国政府俨然以一个独立国家元首的极高规格接待他，不仅安排他到纽约等11个城市发表讲话，而且还安排总统布什、国务卿贝克、国家安全顾问斯考克罗夫特以及前总统卡特等众多政要“亲切”会见叶利钦。<br><br>

心知肚明的叶利钦投桃报李。他在访美期间大肆诋毁共产主义“是一张幸福的乌托邦支票”，盛赞资本主义“繁荣向上”。后来他由衷地感言：从那时起“我已改变了自己的世界观”，“不再是一个共产党人了”。(45)<br><br>

西方还加大对苏联其他反对派代表人物的支持和培养力度。这些人的影响和作用甚至延续至苏联解体以后。<br><br>

俄中友协主席、俄罗斯科学院院士米・列・季塔连科：“西方大量培训原苏联和东欧及中亚未来一代的领导人。比如自由派人物盖达尔也是从那里学的。所有波罗的海国家领导人都在美国接受过培训。而有些国家的总统是直接从美国派过来的。”<br><br>

西方世界利用大众传媒，宣传资产阶级价值观，诋毁和丑化苏联社会主义，削弱和对抗马克思主义，在意识形态领域搞心理战、思想战。<br><br>

西方各国针对苏联和东欧国家的大功率的广播电台每天用6种语言“传播国际以及苏联和东欧国内发生重大事件的信息”，宣传西方社会的“成就”、生活方式和价值观。“英国广播公司(BBC)”和“德意志电波电台”每天甚至用40种语言向世界各地广播。这些大型电台担负着向苏联东欧国家灌输西方意识形态的重任。<br><br>

俄罗斯联邦共产党中央委员会主席根・安・久加诺夫：“(从杜勒斯时代起)他们所采取的一个行动，就是让全世界人民知道，苏联不是取得二战胜利的主要指挥者。苏联是干了很多暴行的国家。干了暴行的国家不值得尊敬，苏联领导人就不值得尊敬，比如说斯大林。”<br><br>

而在“新思维”的引导下，苏共对西方意识形态的进攻进一步敞开了大门。<br><br>

从1988年12月起，苏联停止对西方电台的干扰，并决定拨款400万外汇卢布，进口20个西方国家的报刊。<br><br>

俄中友协主席、俄罗斯科学院院士米・列・季塔连科：“苏联境内基本上被外国的包括美国之音、自由电台、德国之声、日本NHK等外国电台电视台覆盖了。西方的宣传全面影响着苏联的社会和苏联的历史。过去的英雄都被抹黑，像卓娅、马特洛索夫等等。这些卫国战争中的英雄们都被抹黑。这是篡改历史、歪曲历史的开始”;“我们的领导人完全放任了来自西方的宣传……基本上没。有主动防御这些精神土的入侵。所有东西都是失控的、放任自流的。我们没有能够抵抗西方的文化。虽然我们俄罗斯有很多的文艺、文化、文学作品、电影，但都被边缘化了”。<br><br>

西方世界又利用戈尔巴乔夫推行所谓“族际关系民主化”，挑拨苏联各民族之间关系，激化民族矛盾，推动苏联的解体。<br><br>

俄罗斯联邦共产党中央委员会主席根・安・A・加诺夫：“挑起民族事端，由头就是挑动民族情绪，让民族情绪在苏联极端膨胀，然后挑唆民族之间的关系，诱使他们纷争不断，为颠覆国家打下基础。”<br><br>

原苏联驻埃及和土耳其大使埃・古・库利耶夫：“1987年的时候，他们使用手段制造了亚美尼亚与阿塞拜疆的领土争端。亚美尼亚民族分裂主义者占领了阿塞拜疆的部分被认为历史土就属于他们的领土。这是苏联解体的开始。因为苏联是一个统一的国家，在这个统一国家的内部，突然有一个什么加盟共和国跳出来说：历史土这就是我的土地，你应该还给我。局势于是就变得越来越不稳。”<br><br>

原苏共中央书记处书记、前国家杜马副主席瓦・亚・库普佐夫：“美国中央情寺局寻找了几个突破口。从哪里开始呢?他们找到纳戈尔诺――卡拉巴赫 <br><br>
